1,1,PHYS-1-1,"Graph of exposure wavelength versus resolution range.
Line is drawn from the G line to the immersion points, and then down to the EUV and DP (double patterning) line.
The x-axis, marked as the resolution range (measured in nanometers), spans from 10,000 nm down to 1 nm, while the y-axis, denoting exposure wavelength (also measured in nanometers), ranges from 8 nm up to 800 nm.
Over time, the industry has progressively shifted from the G Line at approximately 436 nm, through i-Line at 365 nm, to various forms of deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography.
Immersive and dry techniques utilizing KrF (248 nm) and ArF (193 nm) wavelengths have pushed the boundaries of minimum feature size downwards.
As these methods approached their limits, immersion lithography emerged around these wavelengths, further enhancing resolution by changing the medium between the lens and wafer to water, consequently increasing the effective numerical aperture.
A compelling deviation occurs when the graph dives steeply towards the left as it transitions from ArF immersion to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which employs a significantly lower wavelength of 13.5 nm.
However, moving into the EUV regime demanded overcoming extensive technical hurdles related to light source power, optical system precision, photoresist sensitivity, and mask defectivity.

2,1,PHYS-2-1,"The electromagnetic spectrum is depicted, showing the range of electromagnetic waves from long-wavelength, low-frequency radio waves to short-wavelength, high-frequency gamma rays, with a visible light region highlighted in the center.
Both axes are logarithmically scaled to accommodate the broad range from long waves with frequencies around 10^3 Hz and wavelengths upwards of 10^6 meters, to gamma rays with frequencies as high as 10^24 Hz and wavelengths down to 10^-15 meters.
Within this framework, various bands are identified, including radio waves (long waves and AM (amplitude modulation)/FM/TV), microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.
Analyzing the interactions, the inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency is crucial for understanding electromagnetic wave behaviors.
For instance, long radio waves possess lower frequencies and correspondingly larger wavelengths, facilitating long-distance communication by diffracting around obstacles.
Conversely, gamma rays, characterized by extremely short wavelengths and high frequencies, are highly energetic and capable of penetrating most materials, making them useful in medical imaging yet hazardous due to their ionizing radiation.

Line is drawn from the G line to the immersion points, and then down to the Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography, EUV,  and Double Patterning, DP line. The x-axis, marked as the resolution range (measured in nanometers), spans from 10,000 nm down to 1 nm, while the y-axis, denoting exposure wavelength (also measured in nanometers), ranges from 8 nm up to 800 nm. Over time, the industry has progressively shifted from the G Line at approximately 436 nm, through i-Line at 365 nm, to various forms of deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography. Immersive and dry techniques utilizing KrF (248 nm) and ArF (193 nm) wavelengths have pushed the boundaries of minimum feature size downwards. As these methods approached their limits, immersion lithography emerged around these wavelengths, further enhancing resolution by changing the medium between the lens and wafer to water, consequently increasing the lens’s ability to capture and focus light. A compelling deviation occurs when the graph dives steeply towards the left as it transitions from ArF immersion to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which employs a significantly lower wavelength of 13.5 nm. This drastic shift signifies a pivotal advancement, as leveraging shorter wavelengths permits finer feature sizes and improved resolution, critical for fitting more transistors on a chip. Inferences can be drawn about manufacturing trends and challenges. Initially, the increase in resolution was achieved with relatively small changes in wavelength. However, moving into the EUV regime demanded overcoming extensive technical hurdles related to light source power, optical system precision, photoresist sensitivity, and mask defectivity. This substantial leap is mirrored in the sharp drop on the graph, reflecting the technological leap necessary to bypass physical and material constraints of previously used lithography methods. A noteworthy observation is that despite EUV's theoretical advantages, the development stagnation—evidenced by the flattening of the curve in the EUV region—suggests persistent challenges in practical implementation. Consequently, complementary techniques such as double patterning (DP) have been employed to extend the capabilities of existing lithography methods, seen in the graph’s indication of “Immersion and DP” and “EUV and DP.” These adaptations illustrate the continual pushing of boundaries as the demand for more miniaturized and powerful semiconductor devices escalates."
2,2,PHYS-2-2,"The electromagnetic spectrum is depicted, showing the range of electromagnetic waves from long-wavelength, low-frequency radio waves to short-wavelength, high-frequency gamma rays, with a visible light region highlighted in the center. The axes use a logarithmic scale to show a very wide range of wavelengths and frequencies. Within this framework, various bands are identified, including radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. The key relationship shown is that wavelength and frequency are inversely related, which helps explain how electromagnetic waves behave. For instance, long radio waves possess lower frequencies and correspondingly larger wavelengths which facilitate long-distance communication by diffracting around obstacles. On the other end, gamma rays have very short wavelengths and very high frequencies. They are highly energetic and can penerate most materials. A peculiar observation within the spectrum is the relatively narrow band of visible light (approximately 400 nm to 700 nm) that signifies the range perceivable by the human eye. Although this band occupies only a small portion of the spectrum, it is emphasized because it represents the light humans can see. Another noteworthy point is that energy increases rapidly as frequency increases which follows Planck’s relation where energy is proportional to frequency."
3,2,PHYS-3-2,"A detailed schematic representation of an Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography Exposure System, illustrating its components and functionality. The diagram is segmented into various parts, clearly labeled to indicate their roles. The path of light begins at the EUV source, where radiation is generated and collected by the EUV source collector. It is then shaped by illuminator optics (which condition and evenly distribute the beam), reflected through a series of mirrors, directed onto a reflective mask, and finally projected onto a silicon wafer which is stated to be 300 mm in diameter. The system operates using 13.5 nm radiation, which is crucial for achieving high-resolution patterns necessary for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. Key annotations highlight that the optics are entirely reflective, since EUV radiation is absorbed by most materials and cannot pass through conventional lenses. Additionally, the entire optical pathway functions within a vacuum environment not only for precision, but because EUV light cannot travel far in air without being absorbed. The organization of this exposure system emphasizes the integration of precise optics that focus, reflect, and accurately direct the EUV beam from source to wafer in lithography."
4,2,PHYS-4-2,"The graph displays the cumulative shift of pulsar-orbital time in seconds on the vertical axis against the year on the horizontal axis, ranging from 1975 to 2005. This shift reflects changes measured at periastron, the point where the pulsar is closest to its companion in its orbit. The data points are marked with error bars that represent measurement uncertainty and follow a smooth, downward-curving line, illustrating a trend of increasing negative cumulative shift over time. The line labeled 'General Relativity prediction' closely follows the data points, indicating consistency between observed orbital decay and theoretical predictions. The 'Line of zero orbital decay' is displayed above the data points and prediction line, delineating the lack of orbital decay. The primary finding is that the observed data aligns well with the General Relativity prediction, reinforcing the theory's validity in describing the decay of orbits over time as energy is lost through gravitational wave emission."
5,2,PHYS-5-2,"This schema illustrates the only possible special crystal lattice types in two dimensions, shown through distinct lattice structures and symmetry properties. Each lattice represents a repeating pattern that fills a flat plane. The General Oblique lattice has no special symmetry beyond repetition; its lattice vectors (a₁ and a₂), which describe the directions and spacing used to repeat the pattern, are unequal, and there are no mirror lines or rotational symmetry. The Rectangular lattice has 2-fold rotational symmetry, meaning the pattern looks the same after a 180-degree rotation, and includes mirror symmetry, resulting in a stretched shape compared to a square. The Centered Rectangular lattice is similar to a rectangular lattice, but adds an extra lattice point at the center of each rectangle, which changes how reflections behave compared to the simple rectangular case. The Square lattice has 4-fold rotational symmetry, meaning it remains unchanged under 90-degree rotations, along with mirror symmetry in multiple directions. The Hexagonal lattice has equal lattice vectors and a 60-degree angle between them, producing 6-fold rotational symmetry, where the pattern repeats every 60 degrees, and represents the highest symmetry shown. Together, these lattices define all possible repeating patterns in two dimensions. Translational symmetry means the pattern appears unchanged when shifted by whole-number multiples of the lattice vectors, and the allowed rotational symmetries—2-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold—follow the crystallographic restriction theorem, which limits which rotations are possible in a periodic two-dimensional structure."
6,2,PHYS-6-2,"The illustration presents varieties of crystal lattice structures: cubic body-centered (bcc), cubic face-centered (fcc), and hexagonal. Each structure shows a distinct arrangement of atoms, represented by spheres, with connecting lines indicating bonds within the lattice. The bcc structure includes atoms at the cube corners and one atom at the center. This configuration, common in elements such as iron (Fe), vanadium (V), niobium (Nb), and chromium (Cr), supports efficient packing and strong metallic bonding, contributing to structural strength. The fcc structure places atoms at the cube corners and at the center of each face. This closely packed arrangement is found in metals such as aluminum (Al), nickel (Ni), silver (Ag), copper (Cu), and gold (Au). Its dense packing allows atoms to slide past one another more easily, which explains its high ductility and good electrical conductivity. The hexagonal lattice uses a hexagon-shaped repeating pattern with atoms arranged to maximize packing. This hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure appears in materials like titanium (Ti), zinc (Zn), magnesium (Mg), and cadmium (Cd). It has a coordination number of twelve, meaning each atom touches twelve neighboring atoms, leading to strong atomic bonding and high strength, but less ability to deform compared to fcc structures."
7,2,PHYS-7-2,"Two parallel rays approach a set of equally spaced crystal planes and strike successive planes at the same angle θ. The rays reflect upward at the same angle, remaining parallel after reflection. Because one ray reflects from a lower plane, it travels a longer distance than the other. This extra distance creates a triangular path difference between the two rays, which is used to derive the equation. The vertical side of this triangle corresponds to D, the spacing between adjacent planes. As a result, the path difference between the reflected rays is equal to 2D sin(θ), where D is the distance between planes and θ is the angle between the ray and the planes."
8,2,PHYS-8-2,"The illustration depicts a conceptual representation of electromagnetic induction. At the center, a circular loop is shown, marked with a blue line that outlines its shape. Arrows pointing upward denote an increasing magnetic field, labeled as 𝐵(𝑡), suggesting a change over time. A small positive and negative sign indicates electrical polarity, while a zigzag line represents a resistor connected to the loop. An arrow on one side illustrates the direction of induced current, labeled 𝐼. The current flows in response to the changing magnetic field. Its direction is determined by Lenz’s Law, meaning the induced current opposes the change in magnetic flux. Another arrow indicates the resultant induced magnetic field 𝐵."
9,2,PHYS-9-2,"The diagram illustrates a concept in electromagnetism by modeling an electric generator, where a conducting loop rotates within a magnetic field to induce an electric current. A magnetic field is shown between a north (N) and south (S) pole of a magnet, with field lines indicating the direction of magnetic flux. As the loop rotates through this field, the magnetic flux passing through the loop changes over time, which induces a current in the connected circuit. The angle 𝜓 is defined as the angle between the normal (perpendicular direction) of the rotating coil and the direction of the magnetic field, and this angle determines how much magnetic flux passes through the loop at a given moment. The circuit attached to the loop represents the path through which the induced current flows. Blue shading highlights regions where the magnetic field is present, while arrows indicate directions of motion, force, or field orientation. Overall, the configuration demonstrates electromagnetic induction by showing how mechanical rotation in a magnetic field can generate electrical current."
10,2,PHYS-10-2,"The diagram illustrates the principles of electromagnetic force acting on a conductor that first moves with a velocity u through a magnetic field B. This motion leads to an induced current I flowing through the circuit, which includes a resistor labeled R, with the current direction shown by an arrow. The magnetic field is represented by circles and crosses, indicating its direction relative to the page, and the axes mark the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions. As a result of the current flowing within the magnetic field, a magnetic force Fₘ acts on the conductor, causing mechanical motion. The direction of this force follows the right-hand rule, which relates the directions of current, magnetic field, and resulting force. This representation highlights how motion in a magnetic field produces current, which in turn generates a force on the conductor."
11,2,PHYS-11-2,"The diagram illustrates a magnetic circuit comprising a loop with defined parameters, including a conductive coil and associated currents. The central element is a circular loop with winding numbers ??1 and ??2 labeled on opposite sides, indicating the coil turns connected to voltage sources ??1 and ??2. The radius of the loop is marked as ???? = 10 cm. An arrow within the loop indicates the direction of current ??1(??), suggesting the variable nature of the current over time. As this current changes with time, it produces a changing magnetic field around the coil, which in turn affects the magnetic flux through the loop. The diagram helps to analyze electromagnetic behavior, facilitating calculations of magnetic fields, inductance, and related phenomena in circuits. Key elements like the coil's orientation and current direction reveal potential trends in magnetic flux and illustrate the relationships governing electromagnetic theory."
12,2,PHYS-12-2,"The illustration displays two related diagrams that depict physical systems used to analyze magnetic fields. The left diagram shows a circular loop labeled ??? with path length ??, enclosing an input current ?? that circulates around the loop in the indicated direction. The right diagram shows a concave loop labeled ???, also with path length ?? and enclosed current ??, with the current following the shape of the loop. Both diagrams represent different closed paths that can be chosen when applying Amp�re�s Law, which relates the magnetic field strength along a path to the total current enclosed by that path. The circular loop suggests a more uniform magnetic field along its length, while the concave loop illustrates how changing the path geometry can lead to variations in field strength. Together, the two shapes demonstrate that Amp�re�s Law depends on the chosen path and enclosed current, not the specific shape itself."
13,2,PHYS-13-2,"On the left side, an electric circuit is shown with a voltage source V driving a current I through a resistor R. In this analogy, the voltage V represents the magnetomotive force (MMF), which is the �driving force� that pushes magnetic effects through a magnetic circuit, similar to how voltage pushes electric current. The resistor R corresponds to magnetic reluctance, which describes how strongly a material resists the formation of magnetic flux, much like electrical resistance opposes current flow. On the right side, a magnetic circuit is shown as a toroid wrapped with N current-carrying turns. The current flowing through the coil produces magnetic flux ? (phi) inside the toroid, which is the magnetic equivalent of electric current. Increasing the number of turns N increases the magnetomotive force, thereby strengthening the magnetic flux, just as increasing voltage increases current in an electric circuit. The toroid acts as a closed magnetic path that confines and guides the magnetic field, reducing magnetic leakage and ensuring the flux circulates efficiently within the core material. Together, the diagram illustrates the full analogy between electric and magnetic circuits, showing how electrical concepts map directly onto magnetic behavior."
14,2,PHYS-14-2,"The diagram displays a representation of a helical structure, characterized by a series of spiraling lines that denote magnetic field lines, illustrated in black, along a central axis depicted in green. The helical lines are numbered sequentially from 1 to N, suggesting multiple loops or windings around the axis. Magnetic field lines pass through the surface enclosed by each loop, and each loop adds to the total magnetic effect. Key equations are presented in green text, where ?? = B � S shows that the magnetic flux through one loop depends on how strong the magnetic field is and the area of the loop, while ?? = N?? indicates that the total flux linkage increases as more loops are added. Together, these relationships show that the total magnetic linkage builds up from the contributions of all loops and depends on both the field strength and the number of loops."
15,2,PHYS-15-2,"A toroid has current-carrying conductors at both the inner and outer radii. The current, marked in red, flows into the page at the outer radius and out of the page at the inner radius. These opposing current directions cause the magnetic field to form a closed loop inside the toroid, rather than spreading outward. The magnetic field B, marked in green, flows inside the toroid in an anti-clockwise direction. The direction of the field follows the right-hand rule, where curling the fingers in the direction of the current gives the direction of the magnetic field. Because the field is confined to a circular path inside the toroid, Amp�re�s Law can be applied by choosing a circular loop inside the core, where the enclosed current determines the field strength and direction."
16,2,PHYS-16-2,"This diagram shows a conducting medium arranged in three-dimensional space. The horizontal axis w represents the width of the conductor, the vertical axis h represents its height, and the z-axis points upward, indicating depth. First, the red boxes mark regions where electric current flows. Arrows on these boxes show the direction of current through the material in three dimensions. This means electric charges move through the conductor along the indicated paths, not just in a flat plane but through space. Second, the green circles and crosses represent moving charge carriers, such as electrons, showing whether they move toward or away from the viewer along the z-direction. This helps indicate how charges circulate within the conductor. Third, a magnetic field B is present around the current-carrying regions. As the charges move, they generate magnetic flux around the conductors. When moving charges interact with the magnetic field, a magnetic force can act on them, depending on the direction of motion and the field orientation. Together, the diagram illustrates how current flow in three dimensions produces magnetic flux and can lead to magnetic forces, linking charge motion, current direction, and magnetic field behavior in the system."
17,2,PHYS-17-2,"The diagram illustrates a helical coil, showing its structure in a three-dimensional perspective. Key elements include the dimensions labeled as ?? for diameter and ?? indicating the axial direction, showing how the coil extends in space. There are also markings for ?? representing the number of turns, and ?? defined as the pitch, which is the distance between successive turns. A smaller pitch means the turns are closer together, which increases inductance by strengthening the magnetic field. The light blue color of the coil emphasizes its three-dimensionality and spiraling form."
18,2,PHYS-18-2,"The illustration presents two distinct scenarios related to electromagnetic fields and their behavior concerning closed surfaces. On the left, the diagram represents the electric field around a positive charge (+Q), signifying that the net electric flux through the closed surface is equal to the total charge enclosed, as indicated by the expression ? = Q. Field lines leaving the surface correspond to positive charge, while field lines entering a surface would indicate negative charge. The field lines emanate outward from the charge, clearly showing the directional flow and density of the electric field. On the right, the illustration depicts a magnetic field around a closed surface with no enclosed magnetic charge (N and S denote a magnetic dipole), where the net magnetic flux is represented as ? = 0, indicating that magnetic field lines do not start or end within the surface. Magnetic field lines always form closed loops, entering and exiting the surface in equal amounts. Both diagrams utilize arrows to communicate the direction of field lines, emphasizing the divergence of electric fields and the absence of magnetic monopoles."
19,2,PHYS-19-2,"The horizontal ground on which the weightlifter stands is labeled �y = 0.� The motion of the barbell lift at three positions is shown. In the final position, the barbell is directly above the lifter�s head with arms fully extended vertically. At this final position, the barbell is momentarily at rest, meaning it is not moving. In this position, two arrows point from the center of the barbell: the vector F?weightlifter? points vertically upward along the vertical axis, and the vector w = F?gravity? points vertically downward along the same axis. Because the barbell is not accelerating at this point, Newton�s First Law applies and the forces are balanced. The vertical distance between the ground and the bottom of the barbell is h, and the work done by the lifter in raising the barbell is stored as gravitational potential energy at this final height."
20,2,PHYS-20-2,"Two opposite poles of two different magnets are placed near each other. The magnetic flux density B, marked in green, comes out of the north pole and enters the south pole. A conductor is placed between the opposite magnetic poles and carries a current I, marked in red. The magnetic force F? acts downward, perpendicular to the magnetic flux density. The direction of this force follows the right-hand rule: the thumb points in the direction of the current, the fingers point in the direction of the magnetic field, and the palm shows the direction of the magnetic force."
21,2,PHYS-21-2,"Two circular current-carrying loops, labeled 1 and 2, are placed close to each other and may be parallel or angled relative to one another. Each loop carries a current, with the direction of current flow shown along the circular paths. The current in loop 1 generates a magnetic field that spreads through space and passes through loop 2, linking the two loops magnetically. This interaction is the basis of mutual inductance, where a changing current in one loop can induce an effect in the other. A vector R?? connects a small current element on loop 1 to a point on loop 2, pointing from the source of the magnetic field to where its influence is felt. Together, the loops and vector illustrate how magnetic fields produced by one circuit affect another nearby circuit, forming the physical foundation for inductive coupling."
22,2,PHYS-22-2,"On the left side, a rectangular loop carrying a current I is placed in a magnetic flux density B, marked in blue. The length and width of the loop are labeled L and W, respectively. Magnetic forces act on the current-carrying sides of the loop, and opposite sides experience forces in opposite directions. On the right side, the rectangular loop is tilted so that its width makes an angle with the magnetic flux density B. The forces act perpendicular to B on each side of the loop, but because these forces point in different directions on opposite sides, they create a twisting effect, or torque. This torque tends to rotate the loop so that it aligns with the magnetic field, explaining how magnetic forces produce rotational motion in a current-carrying loop."
23,2,PHYS-23-2,"The image represents a three-dimensional coordinate system illustrating spherical coordinates, characterized by the radius ??, polar angle ??, and azimuthal angle ??. This coordinate system is commonly used to describe the magnetic field produced by a magnetic dipole, such as a bar magnet or a tiny current loop. In this context, the coordinates help specify the direction and strength of the magnetic field at different points around the dipole. The axes are labeled with the x-axis extending horizontally, the y-axis perpendicular to it, and the z-axis extending vertically, which is typically aligned with the dipole�s magnetic moment. The distance ?? measures how far a point is from the center of the dipole, ?? is the vertical angle measured down from the z-axis, and ?? is the horizontal angle measured around the z-axis. A circular shape, marked in blue, signifies the plane in which the angles are defined, while dashed lines show how a point projects onto the coordinate axes. This system emphasizes the relationship between the spherical coordinates and their Cartesian counterparts."

The panels are stacked one over the other, from a to i in the downward direction, with all instances of the left end of the spring vertically aligned. Three vertical, equidistant dashed lines are drawn through the nine panels. The line in the middle is labeled �x equals 0.� The line to the left is labeled �x equals negative A,� and the line to the right is labeled �x equals plus A.�
In each panel, two forces are represented by arrows of two different lengths pointing horizontally from the center of the object. The long arrow has a length that equals the horizontal distance between one vertical dashed line and the next. The short arrow is a little more than half that length. The nine panels are as follows:
 In panel a, the center of the object is at x equals plus A. A long leftward arrow labeled �vector F� points to x equals 0. Here, �vector v equals 0.� Callout 1 reads, �Stretch the spring and release the block from rest at x equals plus A.�

25,2,PHYS-25-2,"A magnet bar is placed in a magnetic field density B, marked in blue. The magnetic field applies forces at the north and south poles of the bar in opposite directions. These equal and opposite forces do not cancel but instead create a twisting effect, or torque, on the magnet. This torque causes the bar to rotate until it aligns with the direction of the applied magnetic field, explaining how magnetic dipoles orient themselves in an external field."
26,2,PHYS-26-2,"The diagram shows the shapes of atomic orbitals as the orbital type changes from s to g. The 1s orbital is spherical, meaning the electron is equally likely to be found in all directions around the nucleus, showing complete symmetry. The 2p orbitals have a two-lobed, dumbbell shape, indicating that the electron is most likely found in two opposite regions, with the orientation changing depending on direction but keeping the same basic symmetry. The 3d orbitals are more complex, with shapes that include four lobes arranged around the nucleus or a flat disc with lobes above and below, showing that electrons occupy specific angular regions rather than all directions equally. The 4f orbitals have many lobes arranged in layered and circular patterns, indicating increased angular complexity and less overall symmetry. The 5g orbitals are the most complex, with multiple discs and many narrow lobes spread in layers, showing that the electron probability is divided among many distinct regions around the nucleus. Overall, the progression from s to g orbitals shows how electron distributions become more structured and directional as angular momentum increases, with each shape representing where an electron is most likely to be found rather than a fixed path."
27,2,PHYS-27-2,"On the left side, magnetic dipoles in a small volume are shown with scattered directions when no external magnetic field is applied, meaning B = 0. In this case, thermal motion causes the dipoles to remain randomly oriented. On the right side, when an external magnetic field B is applied, the magnetic dipoles are oriented in the same direction as the field. Each dipole experiences a torque due to the magnetic field, which causes it to rotate and gradually align with the field over time."
28,2,PHYS-28-2,"The image features two diagrams illustrating the concept of the cross product of two vectors, A and B. On the left, a hand gesture symbolizes the right-hand rule for determining the direction of the resultant vector, A � B, with the thumb pointing in the direction of the resultant and the fingers curling from vector A to vector B. The angle ? is marked, showing the orientation between the two vectors. On the right, a conical surface represents the magnitude of the cross product as the area of the parallelogram formed by A and B. The size of this area depends on the angle between the vectors: it increases as the angle opens and reaches its maximum when the vectors are perpendicular at 90 degrees. This ties the angle between the vectors directly to the magnitude of the cross product, alongside the use of the right-hand rule to determine direction."
29,2,PHYS-29-2,"An S-shaped microstrip patch antenna is shown radiating electromagnetic waves. The shape of the patch controls how currents flow along the antenna, causing charges to oscillate back and forth along the S-shaped path. This oscillating current produces a time-varying electric field, which in turn generates a time-varying magnetic field. The electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic field, and both fields change together as the wave propagates. The direction of wave propagation is perpendicular to both fields, forming a transverse electromagnetic wave. The S-shape alters the current path length and distribution, which affects the radiation pattern, resonance, and directionality of the emitted waves. This illustrates how antenna geometry directly influences electromagnetic radiation behavior."
30,2,PHYS-30-2,"This contour plot illustrates a three-dimensional surface represented in a two-dimensional format, showing the relationship between two variables, ??? and ???. The axes are labeled ??? (horizontal) and ??? (vertical), each ranging from approximately ?3 to 3. The plot features several contour lines in blue, green, and red, with numeric labels such as 100, 250, and 500 indicating constant function values. The contours form a convex pattern resembling a parabolic surface, suggesting a local minimum at the origin where the function value is lowest. Gradient vectors at any point would point perpendicular to the contour lines and toward this minimum, indicating the direction of steepest descent. This shows that as ??? and ??? approach zero, the function value decreases, a key idea in optimization that helps explain convergence toward stable solutions."
31,2,PHYS-31-2,"The 3D contour plot illustrates a scalar field represented by the variable V, shown across the x, y, and z axes. Contour lines mark locations where V has the same value, labeled as V?, V?, and V?. The gradient vector ?V points from lower values of V toward higher values, showing the direction of the steepest increase of the variable in space. Points P, P?, and P? illustrate how moving in the direction of ?V increases V most rapidly compared to other directions. Gradient vectors are perpendicular to the contour lines, which helps determine their direction visually. Where contour lines are closer together, the gradient is steeper, meaning V changes more rapidly over distance; where they are farther apart, the change is more gradual. This way of reading the plot is especially important for electric potential in space, where ?V indicates the direction of the strongest change in potential and helps determine the associated electric field behavior."
32,2,PHYS-32-2,"The image illustrates three distinct vector field representations centered around point P, showcasing different directional behaviors. The leftmost configuration reveals a radiating pattern, where arrows emanate outward from P, indicating a source-like behavior, similar to the electric field around a positive charge where field lines flow outward. The middle arrangement presents an inward-directed flow, with arrows converging toward P, representing a sink-like behavior, analogous to a negative charge where field lines flow inward. The rightmost depiction shows parallel arrows that suggest a uniform flow, indicating constant vector magnitude and direction without variation in intensity."
33,2,PHYS-33-2,"The graph illustrates trends in functional CPU scaling over time, spanning from 2008 to 2030, with a logarithmic vertical axis labeled �Log (Functional CPU Scaling)� and a horizontal axis denoting �Year of 1st Production.� The curves show different strategies used to improve CPU performance as traditional transistor scaling slows. Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) refers to improving performance by optimizing circuit design, layout, and architecture within a given technology node, while System Technology Co-Optimization (STCO) goes further by co-developing the chip together with packaging, memory, and system-level technologies. Key milestones such as 14 nm and 7 nm mark points where shrinking transistor sizes alone provided diminishing returns due to physical and economic limits. The green line highlights a shift away from relying only on smaller transistors toward design-based and system-level solutions, showing how DTCO helps recover performance gains even when scaling slows. This trend explains why performance continues to improve despite the limits of traditional Moore�s-law scaling: innovation increasingly comes from smarter design choices and system integration rather than transistor size reduction alone."
34,2,PHYS-34-2,"The chart shows how semiconductor manufacturing has evolved from 1970 to 2020 by tracking node size, wafer size, and de-magnification ratios. Over time, node sizes steadily decrease, meaning transistors become smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient, which improves chip performance while reducing power consumption. At the same time, wafer sizes increase, allowing manufacturers to produce more chips on a single wafer, which boosts production capacity and lowers cost per chip. The chart also shows increasing de-magnification ratios showing a transition from 1:1 to 4:1, which indicate how lithography systems shrink circuit patterns when printing them onto larger wafers, enabling very small features to be manufactured accurately. These trends explain how the industry continues to improve performance and efficiency by combining smaller transistors, larger wafers, and advanced patterning techniques."
35,2,PHYS-35-2,"The image consists of two graphs representing spectral irradiance over different wavelength ranges, with both displaying spectral parts labeled accordingly. The left graph illustrates the spectral irradiance in nanometers, highlighting a sharp peak around the visible spectrum (approximately 400�700 nm) while tapering off towards the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) ends. This peak occurs because the Sun emits most of its energy at visible wavelengths due to its surface temperature. The right graph features a broader spectral range, incorporating an expanded view from UV to near-infrared wavelengths, with color coding indicating different spectral regions such as UV, visible, and IR (including UVA and UVB). The dominant colors in the visible range create a vivid rainbow effect, emphasizing the intensity of solar irradiance at these wavelengths. Both graphs reveal a notable decrease in intensity beyond the visible spectrum, indicating a significant decline in spectral irradiance as it moves into the infrared and ultraviolet ranges, which has implications for understanding energy distribution and environmental impacts related to solar radiation."
36,2,PHYS-36-2,"The illustration features a series of stylized diagrams that represent how waves behave as they pass through a narrow opening. The leftmost section shows waves propagating in straight, parallel lines, indicated by an arrow. As they reach a barrier with a slit in the middle, the waves pass through the opening. After passing through the slit, the waves bend outward and spread into a circular pattern. The slit acts as a secondary source of waves, emitting new wavefronts in all directions. This spreading is caused by diffraction, which occurs when waves pass through an opening comparable in size to their wavelength. The amount of spreading depends on the slit width and the wavelength: narrower slits or longer wavelengths produce more bending, while wider slits produce less. The right section illustrates this outward-radiating wave pattern, highlighting how diffraction changes wave direction and distribution after the slit."
37,2,PHYS-37-2,"The diagram illustrates a lithography process, focusing on the differences between two exposure scenarios shown on the left and right sides. It consists of five key layers: the mask pattern at the top, followed by representations of the near-field and far-field light distributions, intensity at the resist, and the resulting transferred pattern. The mask pattern shows alternating regions of varying opacity. These opacity differences introduce phase shifts in the light, meaning some light waves are delayed relative to others. In the near-field and far-field regions, the light waves combine differently depending on their phase, creating areas of constructive interference, where waves add together and increase intensity, and destructive interference, where waves cancel out and reduce intensity. This behavior is shown by the solid and wavy lines, with orange and blue indicating different light fields. Phase shifting changes how the light waves overlap, sharpening intensity transitions at the resist. The green lines highlight these intensity variations at the resist layer. The transferred pattern at the bottom shows the final result, where sharper light intensity differences produce clearer, more accurate features in the resist. Overall, the diagram demonstrates how controlling phase through mask design improves pattern definition."
38,2,PHYS-38-2,"The figure illustrates an experiment that uses an interferometer to study molecular properties. In the setup, a beam of particles or molecules is split into two paths, then recombined, producing an interference pattern that depends on the molecules� mass and internal structure. By analyzing how the interference changes, information about the molecules can be extracted. The molecular structure shown represents one of the species passing through the interferometer. The histogram plots signal intensity versus mass, with peaks between 20,000 and 30,000 Da. Each peak corresponds to a different molecular species or structural variant, showing how individual molecules contribute to the measured data. Together, the interferometer and histogram demonstrate how interference patterns are used to distinguish and analyze molecules based on their mass and structure."
39,2,PHYS-39-2,"The image presents a scatter plot of detector counts measured over time as a function of detector position in micrometers (�m). The data form a repeating pattern of peaks and low regions across the detector range. These peaks arise from constructive interference of waves scattered by C?? molecules, creating a diffraction pattern rather than random fluctuations. The strongest peak near 0 �m corresponds to the highest constructive overlap of scattered waves, while the regularly spaced side peaks result from additional interference maxima. The spacing between peaks reflects the spacing and arrangement of the molecules, allowing information about the sample�s structure to be inferred. Overall, the plot demonstrates how diffraction patterns reveal underlying molecular order through wave interference."
40,2,PHYS-40-2,"The representation showcases a scatter plot with a smooth curve fitted through the data points. The x-axis is labeled �Transverse displacement (nm)�, ranging from 0 to 1,000 nanometers, and the y-axis is marked �Norm counts,� extending up to 1.5. Blue dots indicate individual measured data points, while the black line shows a clear sinusoidal trend. This oscillating pattern arises from diffraction effects, where waves interfere constructively at some transverse positions and destructively at others. As the displacement changes, the relative phase of the waves shifts, producing alternating maxima and minima in the counts. The spacing of the peaks and valleys reveals information about the spacing or arrangement of features in the material causing the diffraction, making the pattern useful for probing underlying structure rather than just visualizing the data distribution."
41,2,PHYS-41-2,"The scatter plot shows Macroscopicity versus year from 1980 to 2020. Macroscopicity measures how large, massive, or �macroscopic� a system can be while still exhibiting quantum behavior, so higher values indicate experiments that push quantum effects to larger scales rather than simply larger physical size. Over time, the increase in Macroscopicity, especially the higher values appearing after 2000, suggests scientific progress driven by improved experimental techniques, measurement precision, and data collection methods, rather than changes in scale alone. The highlighted outlier, shown as a red diamond, represents an exceptional experiment that significantly exceeds typical results for its time, making it important because it challenges existing limits and motivates further investigation into how macroscopic quantum effects can be achieved."
42,2,PHYS-42-2,"The image shows several panels illustrating how different laser beam inputs change the resulting interference patterns inside a structured medium. Changing the laser configuration alters the spatial frequency components of the light, labeled kx and kz, which determine how the waves propagate and overlap. When these waves recombine, constructive interference occurs where the waves align, creating bright regions, while destructive interference occurs where waves cancel, producing dark regions. Each panel displays a different arrangement of bright and dark features because the laser input changes the relative values of  kx and kz. Together, the patterns demonstrate how controlling the laser�s spatial frequencies directly controls the interference behavior, linking the visual structures to underlying wave physics rather than just the beam shape."
43,2,PHYS-43-2,"The illustration presents a series of horizontal lines representing the {10} crystallographic orientation, which is a specific plane in the crystal that defines how atoms are arranged within the material. The dots along each line indicate atomic positions in the lattice. The distance D marks the spacing between adjacent crystallographic planes, which plays a key role in determining material properties such as density, mechanical strength, and electrical conductivity. This diagram highlights how the regular, repeating arrangement of atoms and the spacing between planes influence the overall behavior of crystalline materials."
44,2,PHYS-44-2,"The graph shows how the critical magnetic fields of a type-II superconductor change with temperature, plotted against the normalized temperature T/Tc. The lower critical field Bc? represents the magnetic field strength at which magnetic flux first begins to enter the material, marking the transition from perfect diamagnetism to the mixed (vortex) state. The upper critical field Bc? represents the maximum field at which superconductivity can exist; above this value, the material becomes normal. As the temperature approaches the critical temperature Tc, superconductivity weakens, causing both critical fields to decrease, especially Bc?, which drops rapidly. This behavior reflects the reduced ability of the material to expel or sustain magnetic fields as thermal energy disrupts the superconducting state."
45,2,PHYS-45-2,"The image is an STM (scanning tunneling microscope) image of NbSe? taken at 1.8 K under an applied magnetic field of 1 tesla, with a spatial scale of 6000 angstroms. The evenly spaced atomic lattice is visible in the background. Superimposed on this lattice are dark spots that form a regular pattern, representing vortex states in the superconductor. Each dark spot corresponds to a magnetic vortex, where the external magnetic field locally penetrates the material and superconductivity is suppressed at the vortex core. Around each vortex, tiny circulating supercurrents flow, allowing the superconductor to accommodate the magnetic field while remaining superconducting elsewhere. This vortex pattern demonstrates how a type-II superconductor organizes itself under an applied magnetic field, balancing magnetic penetration with superconducting order."
46,2,PHYS-46-2,"As the electron count increases from 20 to 4000, a clear diffraction pattern made of interference fringes gradually emerges. At low electron counts, individual detection events appear scattered and random. As more electrons are recorded, bright regions form where electron waves interfere constructively, meaning their wave crests align and reinforce each other. Dark regions appear where destructive interference occurs, where wave crests and troughs cancel out. The gradual buildup of this pattern shows that each electron behaves like a wave as it travels, even though it is detected as a single particle. This experiment demonstrates the wave nature of electrons, a fundamental result of quantum mechanics, and shows how a well-defined interference pattern emerges from many individual quantum events."
47,2,PHYS-47-2,"The diagram shows a double-slit experiment, where waves pass through two narrow slits and interfere at a detector located a distance L away. The angle ? represents the difference in path length from each slit to a point on the detector, which determines whether the waves arrive in phase or out of phase. Bright fringes appear where the path lengths differ by whole wavelengths, causing constructive interference, while dark fringes form where the waves cancel through destructive interference. Because the two slits act as coherent sources, this setup produces a stable interference pattern. The experiment demonstrates interference from two coherent wave sources and reveals the wave nature of particles such as photons or electrons, a key result in wave and quantum mechanics."
48,2,PHYS-48-2,"The representation consists of two waveforms plotted against a horizontal axis labeled �Position� ranging from 0 to 10, with the vertical axis labeled �y� indicating amplitude. The top waveform is drawn in red, depicting a sinusoidal pattern with an amplitude A = 1 and a wavelength ? = 1.2, while the bottom waveform, shown in black, also has an amplitude A = 1 but with a shorter wavelength ? = 1.0. A shorter wavelength means more wave cycles fit into the same spatial distance, which corresponds to a higher frequency. This is why the lower graph shows tighter oscillations compared to the wider spacing of peaks in the top graph. The inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency is a fundamental concept in physics and engineering, helping explain how waves behave in systems ranging from sound and light to signals and electromagnetic radiation."
49,2,PHYS-49-2,"The depiction consists of two line graphs representing wave functions over a common horizontal axis labeled �Position� ranging from 0 to 10. The top graph shows a single blue sine wave oscillating between 0 and 2, illustrating a simple periodic wave. The lower graph presents two input waves, a red sine wave and a black sine wave, that oscillate out of phase with each other representing individual wave inputs. When waves overlap, superposition occurs, meaning their amplitudes add together at each point. Where the peaks of the waves align, they reinforce each other, producing constructive interference, and where a peak aligns with a trough, they partially or fully cancel, producing destructive interference. The vertical axis labeled �Sum� shows the result of adding the two waves together point by point. The combined waveform demonstrates how complex wave patterns can form from simpler waves, highlighting a key principle of wave physics that applies to sound, light, and other wave phenomena."
50,2,PHYS-50-2,"The graph illustrates a mathematical function representing wave amplitudes relative to wave numbers. The x-axis, labeled �Wave number, k,� spans from 0 to 1.4, while the y-axis, marked �Individual Wave Amplitude,� ranges from 0 to 1. The curve, depicted in black, rises sharply to a peak at around k = 1 and then declines, forming a Gaussian distribution centered at this value. This indicates that k = 1 is the most probable wave number in the wave packet, meaning most of the wave components cluster around this value. The solid black dots align closely with the curve, emphasizing how well the function represents the distribution of wave components. Physically, this graph represents the distribution of wave numbers that make up a localized wave packet. The equation  ??(??)=???100(???1)2/2 shows how tightly the wave numbers are grouped around the central value. The width of the Gaussian reflects the spread in wave number (?k), which is directly related to uncertainty in the packet�s position in space. A narrower spread in k corresponds to a more uncertain position, while a wider spread leads to better spatial localization. This relationship connects the graph to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and explains how localized waves arise from a range of wave numbers in real physical systems."
