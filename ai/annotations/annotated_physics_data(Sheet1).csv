1,1,PHYS-1-1,"Graph of exposure wavelength versus resolution range.
Line is drawn from the G line to the immersion points, and then down to the EUV and DP (double patterning) line.
The x-axis, marked as the resolution range (measured in nanometers), spans from 10,000 nm down to 1 nm, while the y-axis, denoting exposure wavelength (also measured in nanometers), ranges from 8 nm up to 800 nm.
Over time, the industry has progressively shifted from the G Line at approximately 436 nm, through i-Line at 365 nm, to various forms of deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography.
Immersive and dry techniques utilizing KrF (248 nm) and ArF (193 nm) wavelengths have pushed the boundaries of minimum feature size downwards.
As these methods approached their limits, immersion lithography emerged around these wavelengths, further enhancing resolution by changing the medium between the lens and wafer to water, consequently increasing the effective numerical aperture.
A compelling deviation occurs when the graph dives steeply towards the left as it transitions from ArF immersion to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which employs a significantly lower wavelength of 13.5 nm.
However, moving into the EUV regime demanded overcoming extensive technical hurdles related to light source power, optical system precision, photoresist sensitivity, and mask defectivity.

2,1,PHYS-2-1,"The electromagnetic spectrum is depicted, showing the range of electromagnetic waves from long-wavelength, low-frequency radio waves to short-wavelength, high-frequency gamma rays, with a visible light region highlighted in the center.
Both axes are logarithmically scaled to accommodate the broad range from long waves with frequencies around 10^3 Hz and wavelengths upwards of 10^6 meters, to gamma rays with frequencies as high as 10^24 Hz and wavelengths down to 10^-15 meters.
Within this framework, various bands are identified, including radio waves (long waves and AM (amplitude modulation)/FM/TV), microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.
Analyzing the interactions, the inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency is crucial for understanding electromagnetic wave behaviors.
For instance, long radio waves possess lower frequencies and correspondingly larger wavelengths, facilitating long-distance communication by diffracting around obstacles.
Conversely, gamma rays, characterized by extremely short wavelengths and high frequencies, are highly energetic and capable of penetrating most materials, making them useful in medical imaging yet hazardous due to their ionizing radiation.
A peculiar observation within the spectrum is the relatively narrow band of visible light (approximately 4 x 10^14 to 8 x 10^14 Hz or 400 nm to 700 nm wavelength) that signifies the range perceivable by the human eye.
This band, nestled within a minuscule fraction of the entire spectrum, stands out because of its biological significance and the way it demarcates the boundaries between non-ionizing and ionizing radiation."
