1,1,PHYS-1-1,ai/data/image1.png,"Graph of exposure wavelength versus resolution range.
Line is drawn from the G line to the immersion points, and then down to the EUV and DP (double patterning) line.
The x-axis, marked as the resolution range (measured in nanometers), spans from 10,000 nm down to 1 nm, while the y-axis, denoting exposure wavelength (also measured in nanometers), ranges from 8 nm up to 800 nm.
Over time, the industry has progressively shifted from the G Line at approximately 436 nm, through i-Line at 365 nm, to various forms of deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography.
Immersive and dry techniques utilizing KrF (248 nm) and ArF (193 nm) wavelengths have pushed the boundaries of minimum feature size downwards.
As these methods approached their limits, immersion lithography emerged around these wavelengths, further enhancing resolution by changing the medium between the lens and wafer to water, consequently increasing the effective numerical aperture.
A compelling deviation occurs when the graph dives steeply towards the left as it transitions from ArF immersion to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which employs a significantly lower wavelength of 13.5 nm.
However, moving into the EUV regime demanded overcoming extensive technical hurdles related to light source power, optical system precision, photoresist sensitivity, and mask defectivity.

2,1,PHYS-2-1,ai/data/image2.png,"The electromagnetic spectrum is depicted, showing the range of electromagnetic waves from long-wavelength, low-frequency radio waves to short-wavelength, high-frequency gamma rays, with a visible light region highlighted in the center.
Both axes are logarithmically scaled to accommodate the broad range from long waves with frequencies around 10^3 Hz and wavelengths upwards of 10^6 meters, to gamma rays with frequencies as high as 10^24 Hz and wavelengths down to 10^-15 meters.
Within this framework, various bands are identified, including radio waves (long waves and AM (amplitude modulation)/FM/TV), microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.
Analyzing the interactions, the inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency is crucial for understanding electromagnetic wave behaviors.
For instance, long radio waves possess lower frequencies and correspondingly larger wavelengths, facilitating long-distance communication by diffracting around obstacles.
Conversely, gamma rays, characterized by extremely short wavelengths and high frequencies, are highly energetic and capable of penetrating most materials, making them useful in medical imaging yet hazardous due to their ionizing radiation.
A peculiar observation within the spectrum is the relatively narrow band of visible light (approximately 4 x 10^14 to 8 x 10^14 Hz or 400 nm to 700 nm wavelength) that signifies the range perceivable by the human eye.
This band, nestled within a minuscule fraction of the entire spectrum, stands out because of its biological significance and the way it demarcates the boundaries between non-ionizing and ionizing radiation."

The top waveform is drawn in red, depicting a sinusoidal pattern with an amplitude (A) of 1 and a wavelength (λ) of 1.2, while the bottom waveform, shown in black, also has an amplitude (A) of 1 but with a shorter wavelength (λ) of 1.0. The prominent detail is the frequency of oscillation, where the top graph exhibits wider spacing between peaks compared to the tighter oscillations seen in the lower graph, indicating that as the wavelength decreases, the frequency of the wave increases. The contrasting colors enhance the visual distinction between the two graphs, emphasizing the effect of varying wavelengths on the sinusoidal pattern. The primary finding illustrates how wavelength influences the spatial frequency of wave phenomena."

Below, the second graph presents a more complex interplay of two functions: a red sine curve and a black sine curve, both of which oscillate out of phase with respect to one another. The vertical axis in both graphs is labeled ""Sum,"" indicating the resultant values derived from the equations plotted. Notably, the patterns in the lower graph illustrate constructive and destructive interference, underscoring the dynamic relationship between the two waves. This visual representation emphasizes the principles of wave behavior and superposition, illustrating how overlapping waves can create varied amplitudes and frequencies."

Data points are indicated with solid black dots, aligning closely with the curve, emphasizing the function's accuracy in representing wave behavior. The equation 𝑃(𝑘)=𝑒−100(𝑘−1)2/2 suggests a strong concentration of wave amplitude around k = 1, highlighting its significance in the context of wave dynamics."
1,2,PHYS-1-2,ai/data/image1.png,"Graph of exposure wavelength versus resolution range. Line is drawn from the G line to the immersion points, and then down to the Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography, EUV,  and Double Patterning, DP line. The x-axis, marked as the resolution range (measured in nanometers), spans from 10,000 nm down to 1 nm, while the y-axis, denoting exposure wavelength (also measured in nanometers), ranges from 8 nm up to 800 nm. Over time, the industry has progressively shifted from the G Line at approximately 436 nm, through i-Line at 365 nm, to various forms of deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography. Immersive and dry techniques utilizing KrF (248 nm) and ArF (193 nm) wavelengths have pushed the boundaries of minimum feature size downwards. As these methods approached their limits, immersion lithography emerged around these wavelengths, further enhancing resolution by changing the medium between the lens and wafer to water, consequently increasing the lens’s ability to capture and focus light. A compelling deviation occurs when the graph dives steeply towards the left as it transitions from ArF immersion to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which employs a significantly lower wavelength of 13.5 nm. This drastic shift signifies a pivotal advancement, as leveraging shorter wavelengths permits finer feature sizes and improved resolution, critical for fitting more transistors on a chip. Inferences can be drawn about manufacturing trends and challenges. Initially, the increase in resolution was achieved with relatively small changes in wavelength. However, moving into the EUV regime demanded overcoming extensive technical hurdles related to light source power, optical system precision, photoresist sensitivity, and mask defectivity. This substantial leap is mirrored in the sharp drop on the graph, reflecting the technological leap necessary to bypass physical and material constraints of previously used lithography methods. A noteworthy observation is that despite EUV's theoretical advantages, the development stagnation—evidenced by the flattening of the curve in the EUV region—suggests persistent challenges in practical implementation. Consequently, complementary techniques such as double patterning (DP) have been employed to extend the capabilities of existing lithography methods, seen in the graph’s indication of “Immersion and DP” and “EUV and DP.” These adaptations illustrate the continual pushing of boundaries as the demand for more miniaturized and powerful semiconductor devices escalates."
2,2,PHYS-2-2,ai/data/image2.png,"The electromagnetic spectrum is depicted, showing the range of electromagnetic waves from long-wavelength, low-frequency radio waves to short-wavelength, high-frequency gamma rays, with a visible light region highlighted in the center. The axes use a logarithmic scale to show a very wide range of wavelengths and frequencies. Within this framework, various bands are identified, including radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. The key relationship shown is that wavelength and frequency are inversely related, which helps explain how electromagnetic waves behave. For instance, long radio waves possess lower frequencies and correspondingly larger wavelengths which facilitate long-distance communication by diffracting around obstacles. On the other end, gamma rays have very short wavelengths and very high frequencies. They are highly energetic and can penerate most materials. A peculiar observation within the spectrum is the relatively narrow band of visible light (approximately 400 nm to 700 nm) that signifies the range perceivable by the human eye. Although this band occupies only a small portion of the spectrum, it is emphasized because it represents the light humans can see. Another noteworthy point is that energy increases rapidly as frequency increases which follows Planck’s relation where energy is proportional to frequency."
3,2,PHYS-3-2,ai/data/image3.png,"A detailed schematic representation of an Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography Exposure System, illustrating its components and functionality. The diagram is segmented into various parts, clearly labeled to indicate their roles. The path of light begins at the EUV source, where radiation is generated and collected by the EUV source collector. It is then shaped by illuminator optics (which condition and evenly distribute the beam), reflected through a series of mirrors, directed onto a reflective mask, and finally projected onto a silicon wafer which is stated to be 300 mm in diameter. The system operates using 13.5 nm radiation, which is crucial for achieving high-resolution patterns necessary for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. Key annotations highlight that the optics are entirely reflective, since EUV radiation is absorbed by most materials and cannot pass through conventional lenses. Additionally, the entire optical pathway functions within a vacuum environment not only for precision, but because EUV light cannot travel far in air without being absorbed. The organization of this exposure system emphasizes the integration of precise optics that focus, reflect, and accurately direct the EUV beam from source to wafer in lithography."

This shift reflects changes measured at periastron, the point where the pulsar is closest to its companion in its orbit. The data points are marked with error bars that represent measurement uncertainty and follow a smooth, downward-curving line, illustrating a trend of increasing negative cumulative shift over time. The line labeled ""General Relativity prediction"" closely follows the data points, indicating consistency between observed orbital decay and theoretical predictions. The ""Line of zero orbital decay"" is displayed above the data points and prediction line, delineating the lack of orbital decay. The primary finding is that the observed data aligns well with the General Relativity prediction, reinforcing the theory's validity in describing the decay of orbits over time as energy is lost through gravitational wave emission."
5,2,PHYS-5-2,ai/data/image5.png,"This schema illustrates the only possible special crystal lattice types in two dimensions, shown through distinct lattice structures and symmetry properties. Each lattice represents a repeating pattern that fills a flat plane. The General Oblique lattice has no special symmetry beyond repetition; its lattice vectors (a₁ and a₂), which describe the directions and spacing used to repeat the pattern, are unequal, and there are no mirror lines or rotational symmetry. The Rectangular lattice has 2-fold rotational symmetry, meaning the pattern looks the same after a 180-degree rotation, and includes mirror symmetry, resulting in a stretched shape compared to a square. The Centered Rectangular lattice is similar to a rectangular lattice, but adds an extra lattice point at the center of each rectangle, which changes how reflections behave compared to the simple rectangular case. The Square lattice has 4-fold rotational symmetry, meaning it remains unchanged under 90-degree rotations, along with mirror symmetry in multiple directions. The Hexagonal lattice has equal lattice vectors and a 60-degree angle between them, producing 6-fold rotational symmetry, where the pattern repeats every 60 degrees, and represents the highest symmetry shown. Together, these lattices define all possible repeating patterns in two dimensions. Translational symmetry means the pattern appears unchanged when shifted by whole-number multiples of the lattice vectors, and the allowed rotational symmetries—2-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold—follow the crystallographic restriction theorem, which limits which rotations are possible in a periodic two-dimensional structure."
6,2,PHYS-6-2,ai/data/image6.png,"The illustration presents varieties of crystal lattice structures: cubic body-centered (bcc), cubic face-centered (fcc), and hexagonal. Each structure shows a distinct arrangement of atoms, represented by spheres, with connecting lines indicating bonds within the lattice. The bcc structure includes atoms at the cube corners and one atom at the center. This configuration, common in elements such as iron (Fe), vanadium (V), niobium (Nb), and chromium (Cr), supports efficient packing and strong metallic bonding, contributing to structural strength. The fcc structure places atoms at the cube corners and at the center of each face. This closely packed arrangement is found in metals such as aluminum (Al), nickel (Ni), silver (Ag), copper (Cu), and gold (Au). Its dense packing allows atoms to slide past one another more easily, which explains its high ductility and good electrical conductivity. The hexagonal lattice uses a hexagon-shaped repeating pattern with atoms arranged to maximize packing. This hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure appears in materials like titanium (Ti), zinc (Zn), magnesium (Mg), and cadmium (Cd). It has a coordination number of twelve, meaning each atom touches twelve neighboring atoms, leading to strong atomic bonding and high strength, but less ability to deform compared to fcc structures."
7,2,PHYS-7-2,ai/data/image7.png,"Two parallel rays approach a set of equally spaced crystal planes and strike successive planes at the same angle θ. The rays reflect upward at the same angle, remaining parallel after reflection. Because one ray reflects from a lower plane, it travels a longer distance than the other. This extra distance creates a triangular path difference between the two rays, which is used to derive the equation. The vertical side of this triangle corresponds to D, the spacing between adjacent planes. As a result, the path difference between the reflected rays is equal to 2D sin(θ), where D is the distance between planes and θ is the angle between the ray and the planes."

A small positive and negative sign indicates electrical polarity, while a zigzag line represents a resistor connected to the loop. An arrow on one side illustrates the direction of induced current, labeled 𝐼. The current flows in response to the changing magnetic field. Its direction is determined by Lenz’s Law, meaning the induced current opposes the change in magnetic flux. Another arrow indicates the resultant induced magnetic field 𝐵."

A magnetic field is shown between a north (N) and south (S) pole of a magnet, with field lines indicating the direction of magnetic flux. As the loop rotates through this field, the magnetic flux passing through the loop changes over time, which induces a current in the connected circuit. The angle 𝜓 is defined as the angle between the normal (perpendicular direction) of the rotating coil and the direction of the magnetic field, and this angle determines how much magnetic flux passes through the loop at a given moment. The circuit attached to the loop represents the path through which the induced current flows. Blue shading highlights regions where the magnetic field is present, while arrows indicate directions of motion, force, or field orientation. Overall, the configuration demonstrates electromagnetic induction by showing how mechanical rotation in a magnetic field can generate electrical current."

The magnetic field is represented by circles and crosses, indicating its direction relative to the page, and the axes mark the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions. As a result of the current flowing within the magnetic field, a magnetic force Fₘ acts on the conductor, causing mechanical motion. The direction of this force follows the right-hand rule, which relates the directions of current, magnetic field, and resulting force. This representation highlights how motion in a magnetic field produces current, which in turn generates a force on the conductor."

The radius of the loop is marked as 𝑟𝑜 = 10 cm. An arrow within the loop indicates the direction of current 𝑖1(𝑡), suggesting the variable nature of the current over time. As this current changes with time, it produces a changing magnetic field around the coil, which in turn affects the magnetic flux through the loop. The diagram helps to analyze electromagnetic behavior, facilitating calculations of magnetic fields, inductance, and related phenomena in circuits. Key elements like the coil's orientation and current direction reveal potential trends in magnetic flux and illustrate the relationships governing electromagnetic theory."

The left diagram shows a circular loop labeled 𝑆₁ with path length 𝐿, enclosing an input current 𝐼 that circulates around the loop in the indicated direction. The right diagram shows a concave loop labeled 𝑆₂, also with path length 𝐿 and enclosed current 𝐼, with the current following the shape of the loop. Both diagrams represent different closed paths that can be chosen when applying Ampère’s Law, which relates the magnetic field strength along a path to the total current enclosed by that path. The circular loop suggests a more uniform magnetic field along its length, while the concave loop illustrates how changing the path geometry can lead to variations in field strength. Together, the two shapes demonstrate that Ampère’s Law depends on the chosen path and enclosed current, not the specific shape itself."
13,2,PHYS-13-2,ai/data/image13.png,"On the left side, an electric circuit is shown with a voltage source V driving a current I through a resistor R. In this analogy, the voltage V represents the magnetomotive force (MMF), which is the “driving force” that pushes magnetic effects through a magnetic circuit, similar to how voltage pushes electric current. The resistor R corresponds to magnetic reluctance, which describes how strongly a material resists the formation of magnetic flux, much like electrical resistance opposes current flow. On the right side, a magnetic circuit is shown as a toroid wrapped with N current-carrying turns. The current flowing through the coil produces magnetic flux Φ (phi) inside the toroid, which is the magnetic equivalent of electric current. Increasing the number of turns N increases the magnetomotive force, thereby strengthening the magnetic flux, just as increasing voltage increases current in an electric circuit. The toroid acts as a closed magnetic path that confines and guides the magnetic field, reducing magnetic leakage and ensuring the flux circulates efficiently within the core material. Together, the diagram illustrates the full analogy between electric and magnetic circuits, showing how electrical concepts map directly onto magnetic behavior."

Magnetic field lines pass through the surface enclosed by each loop, and each loop adds to the total magnetic effect. Key equations are presented in green text, where 𝜓 = B · S shows that the magnetic flux through one loop depends on how strong the magnetic field is and the area of the loop, while 𝜆 = N𝜓 indicates that the total flux linkage increases as more loops are added. Together, these relationships show that the total magnetic linkage builds up from the contributions of all loops and depends on both the field strength and the number of loops."

The current, marked in red, flows into the page at the outer radius and out of the page at the inner radius. These opposing current directions cause the magnetic field to form a closed loop inside the toroid, rather than spreading outward. The magnetic field B, marked in green, flows inside the toroid in an anti-clockwise direction. The direction of the field follows the right-hand rule, where curling the fingers in the direction of the current gives the direction of the magnetic field. Because the field is confined to a circular path inside the toroid, Ampère’s Law can be applied by choosing a circular loop inside the core, where the enclosed current determines the field strength and direction."

The horizontal axis w represents the width of the conductor, the vertical axis h represents its height, and the z-axis points upward, indicating depth. First, the red boxes mark regions where electric current flows. Arrows on these boxes show the direction of current through the material in three dimensions. This means electric charges move through the conductor along the indicated paths, not just in a flat plane but through space. Second, the green circles and crosses represent moving charge carriers, such as electrons, showing whether they move toward or away from the viewer along the z-direction. This helps indicate how charges circulate within the conductor. Third, a magnetic field B is present around the current-carrying regions. As the charges move, they generate magnetic flux around the conductors. When moving charges interact with the magnetic field, a magnetic force can act on them, depending on the direction of motion and the field orientation. Together, the diagram illustrates how current flow in three dimensions produces magnetic flux and can lead to magnetic forces, linking charge motion, current direction, and magnetic field behavior in the system."

On the left, the diagram represents the electric field around a positive charge (+Q), signifying that the net electric flux through the closed surface is equal to the total charge enclosed, as indicated by the expression Ψ = Q. Field lines leaving the surface correspond to positive charge, while field lines entering a surface would indicate negative charge. The field lines emanate outward from the charge, clearly showing the directional flow and density of the electric field. On the right, the illustration depicts a magnetic field around a closed surface with no enclosed magnetic charge (N and S denote a magnetic dipole), where the net magnetic flux is represented as Ψ = 0, indicating that magnetic field lines do not start or end within the surface. Magnetic field lines always form closed loops, entering and exiting the surface in equal amounts.

In this position, two arrows point from the center of the barbell: the vector F₍weightlifter₎ points vertically upward along the vertical axis, and the vector w = F₍gravity₎ points vertically downward along the same axis. Because the barbell is not accelerating at this point, Newton’s First Law applies and the forces are balanced. The vertical distance between the ground and the bottom of the barbell is h, and the work done by the lifter in raising the barbell is stored as gravitational potential energy at this final height."

On the right side, the rectangular loop is tilted so that its width makes an angle with the magnetic flux density B. The forces act perpendicular to B on each side of the loop, but because these forces point in different directions on opposite sides, they create a twisting effect, or torque.

The 1s orbital is spherical, meaning the electron is equally likely to be found in all directions around the nucleus, showing complete symmetry. The 2p orbitals have a two-lobed, dumbbell shape, indicating that the electron is most likely found in two opposite regions, with the orientation changing depending on direction but keeping the same basic symmetry. The 3d orbitals are more complex, with shapes that include four lobes arranged around the nucleus or a flat disc with lobes above and below, showing that electrons occupy specific angular regions rather than all directions equally. The 4f orbitals have many lobes arranged in layered and circular patterns, indicating increased angular complexity and less overall symmetry. The 5g orbitals are the most complex, with multiple discs and many narrow lobes spread in layers, showing that the electron probability is divided among many distinct regions around the nucleus. Overall, the progression from s to g orbitals shows how electron distributions become more structured and directional as angular momentum increases, with each shape representing where an electron is most likely to be found rather than a fixed path."

The shape of the patch controls how currents flow along the antenna, causing charges to oscillate back and forth along the S-shaped path. This oscillating current produces a time-varying electric field, which in turn generates a time-varying magnetic field. The electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic field, and both fields change together as the wave propagates. The direction of wave propagation is perpendicular to both fields, forming a transverse electromagnetic wave. The S-shape alters the current path length and distribution, which affects the radiation pattern, resonance, and directionality of the emitted waves.

Gradient vectors are perpendicular to the contour lines, which helps determine their direction visually. Where contour lines are closer together, the gradient is steeper, meaning V changes more rapidly over distance; where they are farther apart, the change is more gradual. This way of reading the plot is especially important for electric potential in space, where ∇V indicates the direction of the strongest change in potential and helps determine the associated electric field behavior."
32,2,PHYS-32-2,ai/data/image32.png,"The image illustrates three distinct vector field representations centered around point P, showcasing different directional behaviors. The leftmost configuration reveals a radiating pattern, where arrows emanate outward from P, indicating a source-like behavior, similar to the electric field around a positive charge where field lines flow outward. The middle arrangement presents an inward-directed flow, with arrows converging toward P, representing a sink-like behavior, analogous to a negative charge where field lines flow inward. The rightmost depiction shows parallel arrows that suggest a uniform flow, indicating constant vector magnitude and direction without variation in intensity."
33,2,PHYS-33-2,ai/data/image33.png,"The graph illustrates trends in functional CPU scaling over time, spanning from 2008 to 2030, with a logarithmic vertical axis labeled “Log (Functional CPU Scaling)” and a horizontal axis denoting “Year of 1st Production.” The curves show different strategies used to improve CPU performance as traditional transistor scaling slows. Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) refers to improving performance by optimizing circuit design, layout, and architecture within a given technology node, while System Technology Co-Optimization (STCO) goes further by co-developing the chip together with packaging, memory, and system-level technologies. Key milestones such as 14 nm and 7 nm mark points where shrinking transistor sizes alone provided diminishing returns due to physical and economic limits. The green line highlights a shift away from relying only on smaller transistors toward design-based and system-level solutions, showing how DTCO helps recover performance gains even when scaling slows. This trend explains why performance continues to improve despite the limits of traditional Moore’s-law scaling: innovation increasingly comes from smarter design choices and system integration rather than transistor size reduction alone."
34,2,PHYS-34-2,ai/data/image34.png,"The chart shows how semiconductor manufacturing has evolved from 1970 to 2020 by tracking node size, wafer size, and de-magnification ratios. Over time, node sizes steadily decrease, meaning transistors become smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient, which improves chip performance while reducing power consumption. At the same time, wafer sizes increase, allowing manufacturers to produce more chips on a single wafer, which boosts production capacity and lowers cost per chip. The chart also shows increasing de-magnification ratios showing a transition from 1:1 to 4:1, which indicate how lithography systems shrink circuit patterns when printing them onto larger wafers, enabling very small features to be manufactured accurately. These trends explain how the industry continues to improve performance and efficiency by combining smaller transistors, larger wafers, and advanced patterning techniques."
35,2,PHYS-35-2,ai/data/image35.png,"The image consists of two graphs representing spectral irradiance over different wavelength ranges, with both displaying spectral parts labeled accordingly. The left graph illustrates the spectral irradiance in nanometers, highlighting a sharp peak around the visible spectrum (approximately 400–700 nm) while tapering off towards the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) ends. This peak occurs because the Sun emits most of its energy at visible wavelengths due to its surface temperature. The right graph features a broader spectral range, incorporating an expanded view from UV to near-infrared wavelengths, with color coding indicating different spectral regions such as UV, visible, and IR (including UVA and UVB). The dominant colors in the visible range create a vivid rainbow effect, emphasizing the intensity of solar irradiance at these wavelengths. Both graphs reveal a notable decrease in intensity beyond the visible spectrum, indicating a significant decline in spectral irradiance as it moves into the infrared and ultraviolet ranges, which has implications for understanding energy distribution and environmental impacts related to solar radiation."
36,2,PHYS-36-2,ai/data/image36.png,"The illustration features a series of stylized diagrams that represent how waves behave as they pass through a narrow opening. The leftmost section shows waves propagating in straight, parallel lines, indicated by an arrow. As they reach a barrier with a slit in the middle, the waves pass through the opening. After passing through the slit, the waves bend outward and spread into a circular pattern. The slit acts as a secondary source of waves, emitting new wavefronts in all directions. This spreading is caused by diffraction, which occurs when waves pass through an opening comparable in size to their wavelength. The amount of spreading depends on the slit width and the wavelength: narrower slits or longer wavelengths produce more bending, while wider slits produce less. The right section illustrates this outward-radiating wave pattern, highlighting how diffraction changes wave direction and distribution after the slit."
37,2,PHYS-37-2,ai/data/image37.png,"The diagram illustrates a lithography process, focusing on the differences between two exposure scenarios shown on the left and right sides. It consists of five key layers: the mask pattern at the top, followed by representations of the near-field and far-field light distributions, intensity at the resist, and the resulting transferred pattern. The mask pattern shows alternating regions of varying opacity. These opacity differences introduce phase shifts in the light, meaning some light waves are delayed relative to others. In the near-field and far-field regions, the light waves combine differently depending on their phase, creating areas of constructive interference, where waves add together and increase intensity, and destructive interference, where waves cancel out and reduce intensity. This behavior is shown by the solid and wavy lines, with orange and blue indicating different light fields. Phase shifting changes how the light waves overlap, sharpening intensity transitions at the resist. The green lines highlight these intensity variations at the resist layer. The transferred pattern at the bottom shows the final result, where sharper light intensity differences produce clearer, more accurate features in the resist. Overall, the diagram demonstrates how controlling phase through mask design improves pattern definition."
38,2,PHYS-38-2,ai/data/image38.png,"The figure illustrates an experiment that uses an interferometer to study molecular properties. In the setup, a beam of particles or molecules is split into two paths, then recombined, producing an interference pattern that depends on the molecules’ mass and internal structure. By analyzing how the interference changes, information about the molecules can be extracted. The molecular structure shown represents one of the species passing through the interferometer. The histogram plots signal intensity versus mass, with peaks between 20,000 and 30,000 Da. Each peak corresponds to a different molecular species or structural variant, showing how individual molecules contribute to the measured data. Together, the interferometer and histogram demonstrate how interference patterns are used to distinguish and analyze molecules based on their mass and structure."
39,2,PHYS-39-2,ai/data/image39.png,"The image presents a scatter plot of detector counts measured over time as a function of detector position in micrometers (µm). The data form a repeating pattern of peaks and low regions across the detector range. These peaks arise from constructive interference of waves scattered by C₆₀ molecules, creating a diffraction pattern rather than random fluctuations. The strongest peak near 0 µm corresponds to the highest constructive overlap of scattered waves, while the regularly spaced side peaks result from additional interference maxima. The spacing between peaks reflects the spacing and arrangement of the molecules, allowing information about the sample’s structure to be inferred. Overall, the plot demonstrates how diffraction patterns reveal underlying molecular order through wave interference."
40,2,PHYS-40-2,ai/data/image40.png,"The representation showcases a scatter plot with a smooth curve fitted through the data points. The x-axis is labeled “Transverse displacement (nm)”, ranging from 0 to 1,000 nanometers, and the y-axis is marked “Norm counts,” extending up to 1.5. Blue dots indicate individual measured data points, while the black line shows a clear sinusoidal trend. This oscillating pattern arises from diffraction effects, where waves interfere constructively at some transverse positions and destructively at others. As the displacement changes, the relative phase of the waves shifts, producing alternating maxima and minima in the counts. The spacing of the peaks and valleys reveals information about the spacing or arrangement of features in the material causing the diffraction, making the pattern useful for probing underlying structure rather than just visualizing the data distribution."
41,2,PHYS-41-2,ai/data/image41.png,"The scatter plot shows Macroscopicity versus year from 1980 to 2020. Macroscopicity measures how large, massive, or “macroscopic” a system can be while still exhibiting quantum behavior, so higher values indicate experiments that push quantum effects to larger scales rather than simply larger physical size. Over time, the increase in Macroscopicity, especially the higher values appearing after 2000, suggests scientific progress driven by improved experimental techniques, measurement precision, and data collection methods, rather than changes in scale alone. The highlighted outlier, shown as a red diamond, represents an exceptional experiment that significantly exceeds typical results for its time, making it important because it challenges existing limits and motivates further investigation into how macroscopic quantum effects can be achieved."
42,2,PHYS-42-2,ai/data/image42.png,"The image shows several panels illustrating how different laser beam inputs change the resulting interference patterns inside a structured medium. Changing the laser configuration alters the spatial frequency components of the light, labeled kx and kz, which determine how the waves propagate and overlap. When these waves recombine, constructive interference occurs where the waves align, creating bright regions, while destructive interference occurs where waves cancel, producing dark regions. Each panel displays a different arrangement of bright and dark features because the laser input changes the relative values of  kx and kz. Together, the patterns demonstrate how controlling the laser’s spatial frequencies directly controls the interference behavior, linking the visual structures to underlying wave physics rather than just the beam shape."

The dots along each line indicate atomic positions in the lattice. The distance D marks the spacing between adjacent crystallographic planes, which plays a key role in determining material properties such as density, mechanical strength, and electrical conductivity. This diagram highlights how the regular, repeating arrangement of atoms and the spacing between planes influence the overall behavior of crystalline materials."
44,2,PHYS-44-2,ai/data/image44.png,"The graph shows how the critical magnetic fields of a type-II superconductor change with temperature, plotted against the normalized temperature T/Tc. The lower critical field Bc₁ represents the magnetic field strength at which magnetic flux first begins to enter the material, marking the transition from perfect diamagnetism to the mixed (vortex) state. The upper critical field Bc₂ represents the maximum field at which superconductivity can exist; above this value, the material becomes normal. As the temperature approaches the critical temperature Tc, superconductivity weakens, causing both critical fields to decrease, especially Bc₂, which drops rapidly. This behavior reflects the reduced ability of the material to expel or sustain magnetic fields as thermal energy disrupts the superconducting state."
45,2,PHYS-45-2,ai/data/image45.png,"The image is an STM (scanning tunneling microscope) image of NbSe₂ taken at 1.8 K under an applied magnetic field of 1 tesla, with a spatial scale of 6000 angstroms. The evenly spaced atomic lattice is visible in the background. Superimposed on this lattice are dark spots that form a regular pattern, representing vortex states in the superconductor. Each dark spot corresponds to a magnetic vortex, where the external magnetic field locally penetrates the material and superconductivity is suppressed at the vortex core. Around each vortex, tiny circulating supercurrents flow, allowing the superconductor to accommodate the magnetic field while remaining superconducting elsewhere. This vortex pattern demonstrates how a type-II superconductor organizes itself under an applied magnetic field, balancing magnetic penetration with superconducting order."
46,2,PHYS-46-2,ai/data/image46.png,"As the electron count increases from 20 to 4000, a clear diffraction pattern made of interference fringes gradually emerges. At low electron counts, individual detection events appear scattered and random. As more electrons are recorded, bright regions form where electron waves interfere constructively, meaning their wave crests align and reinforce each other. Dark regions appear where destructive interference occurs, where wave crests and troughs cancel out. The gradual buildup of this pattern shows that each electron behaves like a wave as it travels, even though it is detected as a single particle. This experiment demonstrates the wave nature of electrons, a fundamental result of quantum mechanics, and shows how a well-defined interference pattern emerges from many individual quantum events."
47,2,PHYS-47-2,ai/data/image47.png,"The diagram shows a double-slit experiment, where waves pass through two narrow slits and interfere at a detector located a distance L away. The angle φ represents the difference in path length from each slit to a point on the detector, which determines whether the waves arrive in phase or out of phase. Bright fringes appear where the path lengths differ by whole wavelengths, causing constructive interference, while dark fringes form where the waves cancel through destructive interference. Because the two slits act as coherent sources, this setup produces a stable interference pattern. The experiment demonstrates interference from two coherent wave sources and reveals the wave nature of particles such as photons or electrons, a key result in wave and quantum mechanics."
48,2,PHYS-48-2,ai/data/image48.png,"The representation consists of two waveforms plotted against a horizontal axis labeled “Position” ranging from 0 to 10, with the vertical axis labeled “y” indicating amplitude. The top waveform is drawn in red, depicting a sinusoidal pattern with an amplitude A = 1 and a wavelength λ = 1.2, while the bottom waveform, shown in black, also has an amplitude A = 1 but with a shorter wavelength λ = 1.0. A shorter wavelength means more wave cycles fit into the same spatial distance, which corresponds to a higher frequency. This is why the lower graph shows tighter oscillations compared to the wider spacing of peaks in the top graph. The inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency is a fundamental concept in physics and engineering, helping explain how waves behave in systems ranging from sound and light to signals and electromagnetic radiation."
49,2,PHYS-49-2,ai/data/image49.png,"The depiction consists of two line graphs representing wave functions over a common horizontal axis labeled “Position” ranging from 0 to 10. The top graph shows a single blue sine wave oscillating between 0 and 2, illustrating a simple periodic wave. The lower graph presents two input waves, a red sine wave and a black sine wave, that oscillate out of phase with each other representing individual wave inputs. When waves overlap, superposition occurs, meaning their amplitudes add together at each point. Where the peaks of the waves align, they reinforce each other, producing constructive interference, and where a peak aligns with a trough, they partially or fully cancel, producing destructive interference. The vertical axis labeled “Sum” shows the result of adding the two waves together point by point. The combined waveform demonstrates how complex wave patterns can form from simpler waves, highlighting a key principle of wave physics that applies to sound, light, and other wave phenomena."
50,2,PHYS-50-2,ai/data/image50.png,"The graph illustrates a mathematical function representing wave amplitudes relative to wave numbers. The x-axis, labeled “Wave number, k,” spans from 0 to 1.4, while the y-axis, marked “Individual Wave Amplitude,” ranges from 0 to 1. The curve, depicted in black, rises sharply to a peak at around k = 1 and then declines, forming a Gaussian distribution centered at this value. This indicates that k = 1 is the most probable wave number in the wave packet, meaning most of the wave components cluster around this value. The solid black dots align closely with the curve, emphasizing how well the function represents the distribution of wave components. Physically, this graph represents the distribution of wave numbers that make up a localized wave packet. The equation  𝑃(𝑘)=𝑒−100(𝑘−1)2/2 shows how tightly the wave numbers are grouped around the central value. The width of the Gaussian reflects the spread in wave number (Δk), which is directly related to uncertainty in the packet’s position in space. A narrower spread in k corresponds to a more uncertain position, while a wider spread leads to better spatial localization. This relationship connects the graph to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and explains how localized waves arise from a range of wave numbers in real physical systems."

The vectors emphasize the decomposition of a particle’s position into a reference point plus a relative displacement, as used when describing angular velocity and rotational motion."
3,Fr,PHYS-3-Fr,ai/data/angularMomentumQuantized.png,"A key idea from quantum mechanics: while the total angular momentum 𝐿 of a system has a fixed magnitude, its orientation in space is restricted. Only certain discrete values of the 𝑧-component,  𝐿𝑧=𝑚, are allowed, where  𝑚 is an integer. As a result, the angular momentum vector cannot point in arbitrary directions; instead, it occupies specific cones around the  𝑧-axis. The dashed circular paths represent precession of  𝐿 about the measurement axis. This quantization has no classical analog and reflects the fundamental role of measurement and symmetry in quantum systems, underpinning phenomena such as atomic spectra and magnetic resonance."

In a conical pendulum, the tension in the string splits into two components: the vertical component balances the weight 𝑚𝑔, keeping the mass at a constant height, while the horizontal component provides the centripetal force required for circular motion. Unlike a simple pendulum that swings back and forth, the mass here moves at constant speed in a circle, tracing out a cone in space. The angle 𝜃, radius 𝑟, and height ℎ, are directly related to the speed of the mass, showing how geometry and force balance determine rotational motion in classical mechanics."

The lines are more densely packed near the charges, indicating stronger electric fields in those regions, and spread out farther away where the field is weaker. This visualization emphasizes that electric forces are mediated by an electric field filling the surrounding space, not by direct contact between charges, and illustrates how the 
field’s direction and strength determine the motion and interaction of charged particles."

Between the two charges, the field lines curve away from the center rather than connecting, illustrating a region where the electric fields from each charge oppose one another and partially cancel. The symmetry of the pattern highlights that like charges repel, and the absence of field lines crossing the midpoint emphasizes the 
existence of a point (or region) of zero net electric field. This diagram reinforces the idea that electric fields superpose vectorially and that the resulting field geometry directly reflects the nature and arrangement of the source charges."

The downward arrow labeled weight represents the gravitational force acting on the block. This weight is resolved into two components: 𝑤sin⁡𝜃, acting parallel to the incline and tending to pull the block down the slope, and 𝑤cos⁡𝜃, acting perpendicular to the surface and pressing the block into the plane. An arrow labeled friction points up the slope, opposing the direction of potential motion. The angle 𝜃 is marked at the base of the incline. This diagram 
demonstrates how analyzing forces along and perpendicular to an inclined surface simplifies the application of Newton’s laws, showing how friction and gravity determine whether the block remains at rest, slides at constant speed, or accelerates down the plane."
24,Fr,PHYS-24-Fr,ai/data/blockDiagram2.png,"Detailed free-body diagram of a block on an inclined plane showing all force vectors acting at the block’s center of mass. The plane is inclined at an angle 𝛼, with base 𝑏 and height ℎ. The downward vertical arrow 𝐹𝐺 represents the gravitational force (weight). This force is resolved into two components: 𝐹_𝐺,𝑁, acting perpendicular to the surface and pressing the block into the incline, and 𝐹_𝐺,𝐻, acting parallel to the surface and tending to pull the block down the slope. An upward arrow perpendicular to the plane labeled 𝐹𝑁 represents the normal force exerted by the surface on the block. A blue arrow 𝐹𝑅 acts along the plane, 
representing friction or a resistive force opposing motion. The diagram illustrates how gravity is decomposed relative to the inclined surface and how the normal and frictional forces interact to determine the block’s equilibrium or motion, providing a clear visual framework for applying Newton’s laws on inclined planes."

The downward blue arrow labeled 𝑊 represents the block’s weight acting vertically due to gravity. A green arrow labeled 𝑁 points upward and perpendicular to the inclined surface, representing the normal force exerted by the plane on the block. A brown arrow labeled 𝐹 acts along the surface of the incline, representing the frictional force opposing the block’s tendency to slide down the slope. This diagram illustrates how forces on an incline are not aligned with the horizontal and vertical axes, and highlights 
the role of the normal force and friction in balancing gravity. It provides a clear visual basis for analyzing equilibrium and motion on inclined planes using Newton’s laws."

A horizontal red arrow labeled 𝐹⃗ represents an applied force acting through the sphere’s center. Inside the sphere, a dashed line marks the line of action of the force, and a radial arrow labeled 𝑅 indicates the distance from the center to the surface. The sphere rests on the sloped surface, which sets the direction of motion and contact forces. This diagram is used to analyze translation and rotation together: the applied force can cause both linear acceleration of the center of mass and 
angular acceleration about the center, depending on friction at the contact point. It highlights how rolling dynamics depend on mass distribution (moment of inertia), applied forces, and the incline angle, a key concept in rotational mechanics."
27,Fr,PHYS-27-Fr,ai/data/eulersDisk.png,"The mechanics of Euler’s disk, highlighting the directions of rotation and precession using axial vectors. An orange, tilted disk represents the spinning object in contact with a horizontal surface. An arrow labeled 𝜔 points along the disk’s symmetry axis, indicating the disk’s angular velocity (spin) about its own axis. A vertical arrow labeled 𝛺 represents the precession angular velocity, pointing upward along the vertical axis about which the disk’s orientation slowly rotates. A dashed elliptical curve on the surface shows the path traced by the disk’s point of contact as it precesses. This diagram emphasizes that Euler’s 
disk exhibits two coupled motions simultaneously—rapid spin about its symmetry axis and slower precession of that axis around the vertical—an interplay governed by angular momentum, torque from gravity and contact forces, and energy dissipation due to friction."
28,Fr,PHYS-28-Fr,ai/data/massSpring.png,"A mass–spring system on a horizontal surface used to study one-dimensional motion and oscillations. A small block of mass 𝑚 rests on top of a larger base of mass 𝑀. The block is attached on its left side to a spring fixed to a rigid vertical wall. A horizontal arrow labeled ℓ indicates the displacement of the block along the surface, showing the direction in which the block can move. A downward arrow labeled 𝑚 marks the weight of the block acting due to gravity, while the base mass 𝑀 is shown resting on the ground. The spring exerts a restoring force on the block when it is stretched or compressed, causing the block to accelerate back 
toward equilibrium. This diagram illustrates fundamental concepts in classical mechanics, including Hooke’s law, Newton’s second law, and how spring–mass systems model vibrations, oscillatory motion, and energy exchange between kinetic and potential energy."
29,Fr,PHYS-29-Fr,ai/data/massSpring2.png,"A mass–spring–damper system fixed to a rigid wall. A mass 𝑚 is connected to the wall through a spring with stiffness 𝑘 and a dashpot (damper) with damping coefficient 𝑐, arranged in parallel. An external time-varying force 𝐹(𝑡) acts on the mass in the horizontal direction, producing a displacement response 𝑦(𝑡) of the mass. The spring stores elastic potential energy and provides a restoring force proportional to displacement, while the damper dissipates energy and provides a force proportional to velocity, opposing motion. This system is a canonical model in dynamics and control, illustrating how inertia, stiffness, and damping together 
determine transient response, oscillations, resonance, and steady-state behavior under external forcing."
30,Fr,PHYS-30-Fr,ai/data/errorTime.png,"Line graph titled “Error vs Time” showing how a system’s error evolves over time. The horizontal axis represents time, while the vertical axis represents error on a small scale (on the order of 10−3). The error curve exhibits an oscillatory pattern, repeatedly rising to a peak and then dropping close to zero, with each successive peak increasing in magnitude. Early in time, the error remains very small, but as time progresses the oscillations grow larger, reaching their highest values near the end of the plotted interval."
31,Fr,PHYS-31-Fr,ai/data/energyTime.png,"Line graph titled “Energy vs Time” showing the total energy of a system as a function of time. The horizontal axis represents time, while the vertical axis represents energy, which remains close to a constant value around 0.5. The curve oscillates smoothly with small, regular fluctuations, but does not show any long-term increase or decrease in its average level. This behavior indicates that the system’s energy is approximately conserved, with the small oscillations likely arising from periodic exchange between different forms of energy (such as kinetic and potential energy) or from numerical or measurement effects. Overall, the plot 
illustrates a key concept in physics and numerical simulation: in stable, conservative systems, energy remains bounded and nearly constant over time, even though it may oscillate between different components."
32,Fr,PHYS-32-Fr,ai/data/densityTemperature.png,"Line graph titled “Density vs Temperature at Different Pressure.” The horizontal axis represents temperature, while the vertical axis represents density. Two sets of experimental data are shown for pressures P = 2.5 and P = 2.7, each plotted with data points and small error bars, along with corresponding smooth curves representing ideal gas law predictions at those pressures.
For both pressures, density decreases as temperature increases, illustrating the inverse relationship between temperature and density for a gas when pressure is held approximately constant. At every temperature, the curve for P = 2.7 lies above the curve for P = 2.5, indicating that higher pressure results in a higher density at the same temperature, consistent with thermodynamic expectations.
The ideal gas law prediction curves follow the same downward trend and remain close to the measured data, showing good agreement between theory and experiment. Small deviations between the measured points and the ideal curves suggest minor non-ideal effects or experimental uncertainty, but the overall behavior strongly supports the ideal gas model. The graph visually reinforces the physical principle that increasing temperature causes gas particles to spread out, reducing density, while increasing pressure compresses the gas and increases density."
33,Fr,PHYS-33-Fr,ai/data/vectorAddition2.png,"Vector addition of two forces using a head-to-tail construction and their resulting force. The black vectors F₁ and F₂ are drawn sequentially: F₁ acts at an angle θ₂ above the horizontal baseline, and F₂ begins at the head of F₁, rising steeply with its own orientation defined by angle θ₃. The grey diagonal vector Fᵣ represents the resultant force, drawn from the tail of F₁ directly to the head of F₂, showing the net effect of the two forces acting together. Several angles are labeled to clarify the geometry: φ measures the inclination of the resultant relative to the horizontal, θ₁ shows the angle between Fᵣ and F₁, and θ₂ and θ₃ describe the orientations of F₁ and F₂, respectively. 
Educationally, the figure emphasizes that vector addition depends on both magnitude and direction, not just size, and that the resultant force can be found geometrically or analytically using trigonometry or component methods. This construction is commonly used in statics and dynamics to analyze systems where multiple forces act simultaneously on an object."
34,Fr,PHYS-34-Fr,ai/data/inertiaCylinder.png,"This diagram shows a thick (hollow) cylinder used to illustrate how moment of inertia depends on mass distribution relative to the axis of rotation. The cylinder has height h and rotates about its central z-axis, indicated by the vertical arrow. The inner radius r₁ and outer radius r₂ define the hollow region, with dashed vertical lines showing the cylindrical boundaries that contain the material. Physically, this figure emphasizes that rotational inertia is not determined solely by total mass, but by how far that mass lies from the rotation axis: material closer to r₂ contributes more strongly than material near r₁. This is why a thick or hollow cylinder resists changes in rotational motion more than a solid cylinder of the same mass concentrated near the center. 
In mechanics, this geometry leads directly to the moment of inertia expression 𝐼=1/2*𝑀(𝑟*(2/1)+𝑟*(2/2)) for a uniform thick cylinder, making the diagram especially useful for understanding angular acceleration, rotational kinetic energy, and real-world systems like flywheels, pipes, and rotating drums."

The green curved lines represent the magnetic field B, passing through the loop, while the brown oval shows the conducting coil that bounds the surface Σ. The red arrow labeled i indicates the direction of the electric current flowing around the loop, which sets the orientation of the surface normal n (blue arrow) according to the right-hand rule. The magnetic flux Φ through the loop is determined by how much of the magnetic field penetrates the enclosed surface and by the angle between the field and the normal vector, expressed mathematically as Φ=∫B⋅dA. 
Educationally, the diagram highlights that flux is maximized when the magnetic field is aligned with n and reduced when the field is tilted or partially bypasses the surface. This concept is fundamental to electromagnetic induction, explaining how changing magnetic flux through a coil generates an induced voltage, as described by Faraday’s law, and underpins technologies such as generators, transformers, and inductive sensors."

The two brown loops, labeled Γ₁ and Γ₂, bound the surfaces Σ₁ and Σ₂, shown in green, with their corresponding outward normal vectors n₁ and n₂ indicated in blue. Currents i₁ and i₂ flow around each loop, establishing magnetic fields whose field lines (green curves) pass through both surfaces. 
The key idea shown is that the magnetic field produced by the current in one coil threads the surface of the other, creating a magnetic flux that couples the two circuits. Educationally, this illustrates how a changing current in coil Γ₁ alters the magnetic flux through Σ₂ and can induce an electromotive force in coil Γ₂, and vice versa, as described by Faraday’s law and quantified by the mutual inductance coefficient. 
This physical coupling underlies the operation of transformers, wireless power transfer, and many inductive sensing and communication systems."
37,Fr,PHYS-37-Fr,ai/data/magneticCurrent.png,"The theoretical concept of magnetic current 𝑀, represented by circulating orange loops, producing an associated electric field 𝐸, shown by the green arrows pointing to the right. In this visualization, magnetic current is treated as if it were a flow of magnetic monopoles, even though such monopoles have not been observed in nature. The orientation of the electric field relative to the magnetic current follows a left-hand rule, emphasizing the symmetry that would exist between electricity and magnetism if magnetic charges were real. 
This diagram is used to extend Maxwell’s equations into a symmetric form, helping students understand electromagnetic duality: just as electric currents generate magnetic fields, hypothetical magnetic currents would generate electric fields. This perspective is especially valuable in advanced electromagnetism, antenna theory, and computational modeling, where magnetic currents serve as powerful mathematical tools for analyzing radiation, boundary conditions, and wave propagation, even though they are not physically realized."

The particles travel in straight lines between collisions, changing direction only when they collide with other particles or the container walls. The variation in trail length and direction indicates that particles have a range of speeds and move isotropically, reflecting the microscopic origin of temperature as a measure of average kinetic energy.
The diagram emphasizes that gas pressure arises from countless elastic collisions with the container walls, while macroscopic properties like pressure, temperature, and volume emerge statistically from this chaotic microscopic motion. It also highlights key assumptions of the kinetic model: particles are far apart, intermolecular forces are negligible except during collisions, and total kinetic energy increases as temperature rises."
39,Fr,PHYS-39-Fr,ai/data/circuitDiagram.png,"This circuit diagram shows a DC resistive network powered by a 5 V voltage source (V5), with an ammeter placed in series to measure the total circuit current. Starting from the source, current flows through a 100 Ω resistor (R9), then splits across a parallel branch consisting of R10 (200 Ω) and R11 (100 Ω), illustrating how parallel paths reduce equivalent resistance and divide current according to Ohm’s law. The currents recombine and pass through R12 (400 Ω) in series before entering a second, more complex parallel network made up of R13 (300 Ω), R14 (200 Ω), and R15 (100 Ω), which further demonstrates current division and equivalent resistance in multi-branch systems. 
The return path connects back to ground, completing the loop. Educationally, this diagram reinforces key circuit-analysis concepts such as series–parallel reduction, Kirchhoff’s current and voltage laws, and the relationship between resistance and current distribution. It also highlights how the ammeter must be placed in series to correctly measure total current and how real circuits combine multiple resistor configurations to control voltage drops and power dissipation."

After leaving the positive terminal, current flows through the ammeter and then reaches a junction where it splits into three parallel branches containing resistors R6 (164 Ω), R7 (264 Ω), and R8 (364 Ω). Because these resistors are connected in parallel, each branch experiences the same voltage drop of 10 V, while the current divides among the branches according to their resistance values, with the smallest resistor carrying the largest share of current. The individual branch currents recombine at the lower node and return to ground, completing the circuit. Educationally, this diagram reinforces key ideas from Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s current law: parallel connections reduce the equivalent resistance of the circuit, increase the total current drawn from the source, and require that the sum of the branch currents equals the current measured by the ammeter."

A 5.64 V voltage source (V5) is connected to the circuit through a single-pole switch (SW2), which controls whether the circuit is energized. When the switch is closed, current flows from the source to a node that feeds a resistor R7 (6.64 Ω) and a capacitor C4 (1.64 µF) connected in parallel to ground. The resistor provides an immediate conduction path, while the capacitor initially behaves like a short circuit and begins to store electric charge. Over time, the capacitor voltage rises toward the supply voltage as the charging current decreases exponentially, governed by the RC time constant τ = R7·C4. When the switch is opened, the source is disconnected and the capacitor discharges through the resistor, releasing its stored energy as the voltage across C4 decays back toward zero. This circuit visually reinforces core concepts in transient analysis, including switch-controlled dynamics, energy storage in capacitors, and exponential voltage and current behavior in RC systems."

The galaxy, NGC 4388, appears as a thin, elongated disk with a bright, dusty central region and mottled bands of dark brown dust and glowing pink and blue star-forming regions running along its length. Extending from the galaxy’s nucleus toward the lower-right side of the image is a faint but striking plume of glowing gas, appearing bluish and wispy as it billows away from the disk. This luminous outflow contrasts with the softer, pale halo surrounding the galaxy and reveals gas being stripped from NGC 4388 as it moves through the hot intracluster medium of the Virgo galaxy cluster, about 60 million light-years away. The glow of the gas is thought to be powered partly by energetic radiation from the galaxy’s central supermassive black hole and partly by shock waves farther from the disk. The image combines multiple wavelengths from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, highlighting both the galaxy’s structure and the extended ionized gas cloud that was not visible in earlier observations."

Each panel is labeled with a band identifier and wavelength, ranging from about 5 to 26 microns. In every image, a bright, roughly circular white-yellow spot marks the star HD 37122 against a dark red background, with a dashed cyan circle indicating a one–arcsecond radius around the star’s expected position. At shorter wavelengths, the star appears very bright and slightly extended, while at longer wavelengths it becomes fainter and more compact, eventually blending with a smoother orange glow caused by thermal emission from the telescope itself. Together, the panels demonstrate the image quality, spatial alignment, and wavelength coverage of the twelve MRS spectral bands used to create three-dimensional data cubes that combine imaging and spectroscopy."

A red curve labeled “Webb MIRI-MRS” shows finely detailed structure, including a very tall, narrow spike near 9.65 micrometers and a smaller nearby feature, demonstrating the high spectral resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope’s Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer. In contrast, a blue curve labeled “Spitzer IRS” traces a smoother, broader peak over the same wavelength range, reflecting the lower spectral resolution of the earlier Spitzer Space Telescope. The sharp red emission feature corresponds to molecular hydrogen emission from the active galactic nucleus of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 6552, while the comparison highlights how Webb’s MRS can resolve closely spaced atomic and molecular features that appear blended in lower-resolution data."
45,Fr,PHYS-45-Fr,ai/data/forceTime.png,"Three stacked graphs illustrate how energy is added to a swinging motion through an external driving force, using the example of pushing a child on a swing. In the top graph, position 𝑥 is plotted versus time 𝑡, showing oscillations that start small and gradually grow in amplitude, representing how repeated, well-timed pushes add more and more energy to the child’s motion. The middle graph shows force 𝐹 versus time 𝑡 for a fairly realistic driving force: a sequence of short, periodic pulses that correspond to brief pushes applied at regular intervals, such as when a person pushes the swing at the right moment each cycle. The bottom graph also plots force 𝐹 versus time 𝑡, but here the force is represented as a smooth sinusoidal wave. This simplified driving force is less realistic physically, since real pushes are brief rather than continuous, but it is mathematically convenient and captures the essential idea of a periodic force driving the oscillation and transferring energy into the system."

Each panel represents a different wave interaction, captured from a filmed experiment in which one end of the spring was shaken by hand and individual frames were selected to show the motion over time.
In panel 1 (left), a single wave pulse travels steadily to the left along the spring. The spring’s coils form a localized bulge that moves frame by frame while the rest of the spring remains nearly straight, showing the propagation of a single pulse.
In panel 2 (center), two positive pulses approach each other from opposite directions. As they collide, the spring’s displacement increases where the pulses overlap, demonstrating superposition: the combined pulse has a larger amplitude during the overlap before the pulses pass through each other and continue on unchanged.
In panel 3 (right), a positive pulse and a negative pulse collide. When they overlap, the upward and downward displacements partially cancel, producing a reduced or nearly flat displacement at the point of superposition. Afterward, each pulse continues traveling in its original direction, illustrating destructive superposition."

The uniform spacing between the bands indicates a constant wavelength as the wave fronts propagate in parallel lines. A small symbol marks the wavelength measured between adjacent wave crests.
In the right panel, circular water waves spread outward from a point source at the center of the tank, forming a series of concentric bright and dark rings. Each ring corresponds to a wave crest or trough, and the spacing between successive rings shows the wavelength of the circular waves.

On the left side, behind the source, the wave crests are spread farther apart, indicating a longer wavelength for backward-going waves. The source itself is visible near the center-right, attached to a vertical rod that drives the motion. The asymmetric spacing of the rings visually demonstrates how motion of a wave source changes the observed wavelength, a hallmark of the Doppler effect."
