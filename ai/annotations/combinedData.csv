1,/image1.png,"Graph of exposure wavelength versus resolution range. Line is drawn from the G line to the immersion points, and then down to the EUV and DP (double patterning) line. The x-axis, marked as the resolution range (measured in nanometers), spans from 10,000 nm down to 1 nm, while the y-axis, denoting exposure wavelength (also measured in nanometers), ranges from 8 nm up to 800 nm. Over time, the industry has progressively shifted from the G Line at approximately 436 nm, through i-Line at 365 nm, to various forms of deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography. Immersive and dry techniques utilizing KrF (248 nm) and ArF (193 nm) wavelengths have pushed the boundaries of minimum feature size downwards. As these methods approached their limits, immersion lithography emerged around these wavelengths, further enhancing resolution by changing the medium between the lens and wafer to water, consequently increasing the effective numerical aperture. A compelling deviation occurs when the graph dives steeply towards the left as it transitions from ArF immersion to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which employs a significantly lower wavelength of 13.5 nm. However, moving into the EUV regime demanded overcoming extensive technical hurdles related to light source power, optical system precision, photoresist sensitivity, and mask defectivity. Numerical aperture indicates how tightly the optics can focus light."
2,/image2.png,"The electromagnetic spectrum is depicted, showing the range of electromagnetic waves from long-wavelength, low-frequency radio waves to short-wavelength, high-frequency gamma rays, with a visible light region highlighted in the center. Both axes are logarithmically scaled to accommodate the broad range from long waves with frequencies around 10^3 Hz and wavelengths upwards of 10^6 meters, to gamma rays with frequencies as high as 10^24 Hz and wavelengths down to 10^-15 meters. Within this framework, various bands are identified, including radio waves (long waves and AM (amplitude modulation)/FM/TV), microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. Analyzing the interactions, the inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency is crucial for understanding electromagnetic wave behaviors. For instance, long radio waves possess lower frequencies and correspondingly larger wavelengths, facilitating long-distance communication by diffracting around obstacles. Conversely, gamma rays, characterized by extremely short wavelengths and high frequencies, are highly energetic and capable of penetrating most materials, making them useful in medical imaging yet hazardous due to their ionizing radiation. A peculiar observation within the spectrum is the relatively narrow band of visible light (approximately 4 x 10^14 to 8 x 10^14 Hz or 400 nm to 700 nm wavelength) that signifies the range perceivable by the human eye. This band, nestled within a minuscule fraction of the entire spectrum, stands out because of its biological significance and the way it demarcates the boundaries between non-ionizing and ionizing radiation."

As these methods approached their limits, immersion lithography emerged around these wavelengths, further enhancing resolution by changing the medium between the lens and wafer to water, consequently increasing the lens’s ability to capture and focus light. A compelling deviation occurs when the graph dives steeply towards the left as it transitions from ArF immersion to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which employs a significantly lower wavelength of 13.5 nm. This drastic shift signifies a pivotal advancement, as leveraging shorter wavelengths permits finer feature sizes and improved resolution, critical for fitting more transistors on a chip. Inferences can be drawn about manufacturing trends and challenges. Initially, the increase in resolution was achieved with relatively small changes in wavelength. However, moving into the EUV regime demanded overcoming extensive technical hurdles related to light source power, optical system precision, photoresist sensitivity, and mask defectivity. This substantial leap is mirrored in the sharp drop on the graph, reflecting the technological leap necessary to bypass physical and material constraints of previously used lithography methods. A noteworthy observation is that despite EUV's theoretical advantages, the development stagnation—evidenced by the flattening of the curve in the EUV region—suggests persistent challenges in practical implementation. Consequently, complementary techniques such as double patterning (DP) have been employed to extend the capabilities of existing lithography methods, seen in the graph’s indication of “Immersion and DP” and “EUV and DP.” These adaptations illustrate the continual pushing of boundaries as the demand for more miniaturized and powerful semiconductor devices escalates."
52,/image2.png,"The electromagnetic spectrum is depicted, showing the range of electromagnetic waves from long-wavelength, low-frequency radio waves to short-wavelength, high-frequency gamma rays, with a visible light region highlighted in the center. The axes use a logarithmic scale to show a very wide range of wavelengths and frequencies. Within this framework, various bands are identified, including radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. The key relationship shown is that wavelength and frequency are inversely related, which helps explain how electromagnetic waves behave. For instance, long radio waves possess lower frequencies and correspondingly larger wavelengths which facilitate long-distance communication by diffracting around obstacles. On the other end, gamma rays have very short wavelengths and very high frequencies. They are highly energetic and can penerate most materials. A peculiar observation within the spectrum is the relatively narrow band of visible light (approximately 400 nm to 700 nm) that signifies the range perceivable by the human eye. Although this band occupies only a small portion of the spectrum, it is emphasized because it represents the light humans can see. Another noteworthy point is that energy increases rapidly as frequency increases which follows Planck’s relation where energy is proportional to frequency."
53,/image3.png,"A detailed schematic representation of an Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography Exposure System, illustrating its components and functionality. The diagram is segmented into various parts, clearly labeled to indicate their roles. The path of light begins at the EUV source, where radiation is generated and collected by the EUV source collector. It is then shaped by illuminator optics (which condition and evenly distribute the beam), reflected through a series of mirrors, directed onto a reflective mask, and finally projected onto a silicon wafer which is stated to be 300 mm in diameter. The system operates using 13.5 nm radiation, which is crucial for achieving high-resolution patterns necessary for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. Key annotations highlight that the optics are entirely reflective, since EUV radiation is absorbed by most materials and cannot pass through conventional lenses. Additionally, the entire optical pathway functions within a vacuum environment not only for precision, but because EUV light cannot travel far in air without being absorbed. The organization of this exposure system emphasizes the integration of precise optics that focus, reflect, and accurately direct the EUV beam from source to wafer in lithography."
54,/image4.png,"The graph displays the cumulative shift of pulsar-orbital time in seconds on the vertical axis against the year on the horizontal axis ranging from 1975 to 2005. This shift reflects changes measured at periastron the point where the pulsar is closest to its companion in its orbit. The data points are marked with error bars that represent measurement uncertainty and follow a smooth downward-curving line illustrating a trend of increasing negative cumulative shift over time. The line labeled "General Relativity prediction" closely follows the data points indicating consistency between observed orbital decay and theoretical predictions. The "Line of zero orbital decay" is displayed above the data points and prediction line delineating the lack of orbital decay. The primary finding is that the observed data aligns well with the General Relativity prediction reinforcing the theory's validity in describing the decay of orbits over time as energy is lost through gravitational wave emission."
55,/image5.png,"This schema illustrates the only possible special crystal lattice types in two dimensions, shown through distinct lattice structures and symmetry properties. Each lattice represents a repeating pattern that fills a flat plane. The General Oblique lattice has no special symmetry beyond repetition; its lattice vectors (a₁ and a₂), which describe the directions and spacing used to repeat the pattern, are unequal, and there are no mirror lines or rotational symmetry. The Rectangular lattice has 2-fold rotational symmetry, meaning the pattern looks the same after a 180-degree rotation, and includes mirror symmetry, resulting in a stretched shape compared to a square. The Centered Rectangular lattice is similar to a rectangular lattice, but adds an extra lattice point at the center of each rectangle, which changes how reflections behave compared to the simple rectangular case. The Square lattice has 4-fold rotational symmetry, meaning it remains unchanged under 90-degree rotations, along with mirror symmetry in multiple directions. The Hexagonal lattice has equal lattice vectors and a 60-degree angle between them, producing 6-fold rotational symmetry, where the pattern repeats every 60 degrees, and represents the highest symmetry shown. Together, these lattices define all possible repeating patterns in two dimensions. Translational symmetry means the pattern appears unchanged when shifted by whole-number multiples of the lattice vectors, and the allowed rotational symmetries—2-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold—follow the crystallographic restriction theorem, which limits which rotations are possible in a periodic two-dimensional structure."
56,/image6.png,"The illustration presents varieties of crystal lattice structures: cubic body-centered (bcc), cubic face-centered (fcc), and hexagonal. Each structure shows a distinct arrangement of atoms, represented by spheres, with connecting lines indicating bonds within the lattice. The bcc structure includes atoms at the cube corners and one atom at the center. This configuration, common in elements such as iron (Fe), vanadium (V), niobium (Nb), and chromium (Cr), supports efficient packing and strong metallic bonding, contributing to structural strength. The fcc structure places atoms at the cube corners and at the center of each face. This closely packed arrangement is found in metals such as aluminum (Al), nickel (Ni), silver (Ag), copper (Cu), and gold (Au). Its dense packing allows atoms to slide past one another more easily, which explains its high ductility and good electrical conductivity. The hexagonal lattice uses a hexagon-shaped repeating pattern with atoms arranged to maximize packing. This hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure appears in materials like titanium (Ti), zinc (Zn), magnesium (Mg), and cadmium (Cd). It has a coordination number of twelve, meaning each atom touches twelve neighboring atoms, leading to strong atomic bonding and high strength, but less ability to deform compared to fcc structures."
57,/image7.png,"Two parallel rays approach a set of equally spaced crystal planes and strike successive planes at the same angle θ. The rays reflect upward at the same angle, remaining parallel after reflection. Because one ray reflects from a lower plane, it travels a longer distance than the other. This extra distance creates a triangular path difference between the two rays, which is used to derive the equation. The vertical side of this triangle corresponds to D, the spacing between adjacent planes. As a result, the path difference between the reflected rays is equal to 2D sin(θ), where D is the distance between planes and θ is the angle between the ray and the planes."
58,/image8.png,"The illustration depicts a conceptual representation of electromagnetic induction. At the center, a circular loop is shown, marked with a blue line that outlines its shape. Arrows pointing upward denote an increasing magnetic field, labeled as 𝐵(𝑡), suggesting a change over time. A small positive and negative sign indicates electrical polarity, while a zigzag line represents a resistor connected to the loop. An arrow on one side illustrates the direction of induced current, labeled 𝐼. The current flows in response to the changing magnetic field. Its direction is determined by Lenz’s Law, meaning the induced current opposes the change in magnetic flux. Another arrow indicates the resultant induced magnetic field 𝐵."
59,/image9.png,"The diagram illustrates a concept in electromagnetism by modeling an electric generator, where a conducting loop rotates within a magnetic field to induce an electric current. A magnetic field is shown between a north (N) and south (S) pole of a magnet, with field lines indicating the direction of magnetic flux. As the loop rotates through this field, the magnetic flux passing through the loop changes over time, which induces a current in the connected circuit. The angle 𝜓 is defined as the angle between the normal (perpendicular direction) of the rotating coil and the direction of the magnetic field, and this angle determines how much magnetic flux passes through the loop at a given moment. The circuit attached to the loop represents the path through which the induced current flows. Blue shading highlights regions where the magnetic field is present, while arrows indicate directions of motion, force, or field orientation. Overall, the configuration demonstrates electromagnetic induction by showing how mechanical rotation in a magnetic field can generate electrical current."
60,/image10.png,"The diagram illustrates the principles of electromagnetic force acting on a conductor that first moves with a velocity u through a magnetic field B. This motion leads to an induced current I flowing through the circuit, which includes a resistor labeled R, with the current direction shown by an arrow. The magnetic field is represented by circles and crosses, indicating its direction relative to the page, and the axes mark the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions. As a result of the current flowing within the magnetic field, a magnetic force Fₘ acts on the conductor, causing mechanical motion. The direction of this force follows the right-hand rule, which relates the directions of current, magnetic field, and resulting force. This representation highlights how motion in a magnetic field produces current, which in turn generates a force on the conductor."
61,/image11.png,"The diagram illustrates a magnetic circuit comprising a loop with defined parameters, including a conductive coil and associated currents. The central element is a circular loop with winding numbers 𝑁1 and 𝑁2 labeled on opposite sides, indicating the coil turns connected to voltage sources 𝑉1 and 𝑉2. The radius of the loop is marked as 𝑟𝑜 = 10 cm. An arrow within the loop indicates the direction of current 𝑖1(𝑡), suggesting the variable nature of the current over time. As this current changes with time, it produces a changing magnetic field around the coil, which in turn affects the magnetic flux through the loop. The diagram helps to analyze electromagnetic behavior, facilitating calculations of magnetic fields, inductance, and related phenomena in circuits. Key elements like the coil's orientation and current direction reveal potential trends in magnetic flux and illustrate the relationships governing electromagnetic theory."
62,/image12.png,"The illustration displays two related diagrams that depict physical systems used to analyze magnetic fields. The left diagram shows a circular loop labeled 𝑆₁ with path length 𝐿, enclosing an input current 𝐼 that circulates around the loop in the indicated direction. The right diagram shows a concave loop labeled 𝑆₂, also with path length 𝐿 and enclosed current 𝐼, with the current following the shape of the loop. Both diagrams represent different closed paths that can be chosen when applying Ampère’s Law, which relates the magnetic field strength along a path to the total current enclosed by that path. The circular loop suggests a more uniform magnetic field along its length, while the concave loop illustrates how changing the path geometry can lead to variations in field strength. Together, the two shapes demonstrate that Ampère’s Law depends on the chosen path and enclosed current, not the specific shape itself."
63,/image13.png,"On the left side, an electric circuit is shown with a voltage source V driving a current I through a resistor R. In this analogy, the voltage V represents the magnetomotive force (MMF), which is the “driving force” that pushes magnetic effects through a magnetic circuit, similar to how voltage pushes electric current. The resistor R corresponds to magnetic reluctance, which describes how strongly a material resists the formation of magnetic flux, much like electrical resistance opposes current flow. On the right side, a magnetic circuit is shown as a toroid wrapped with N current-carrying turns. The current flowing through the coil produces magnetic flux Φ (phi) inside the toroid, which is the magnetic equivalent of electric current. Increasing the number of turns N increases the magnetomotive force, thereby strengthening the magnetic flux, just as increasing voltage increases current in an electric circuit. The toroid acts as a closed magnetic path that confines and guides the magnetic field, reducing magnetic leakage and ensuring the flux circulates efficiently within the core material. Together, the diagram illustrates the full analogy between electric and magnetic circuits, showing how electrical concepts map directly onto magnetic behavior."
64,/image14.png,"The diagram displays a representation of a helical structure, characterized by a series of spiraling lines that denote magnetic field lines, illustrated in black, along a central axis depicted in green. The helical lines are numbered sequentially from 1 to N, suggesting multiple loops or windings around the axis. Magnetic field lines pass through the surface enclosed by each loop, and each loop adds to the total magnetic effect. Key equations are presented in green text, where 𝜓 = B · S shows that the magnetic flux through one loop depends on how strong the magnetic field is and the area of the loop, while 𝜆 = N𝜓 indicates that the total flux linkage increases as more loops are added. Together, these relationships show that the total magnetic linkage builds up from the contributions of all loops and depends on both the field strength and the number of loops."
65,/image15.png,"A toroid has current-carrying conductors at both the inner and outer radii. The current, marked in red, flows into the page at the outer radius and out of the page at the inner radius. These opposing current directions cause the magnetic field to form a closed loop inside the toroid, rather than spreading outward. The magnetic field B, marked in green, flows inside the toroid in an anti-clockwise direction. The direction of the field follows the right-hand rule, where curling the fingers in the direction of the current gives the direction of the magnetic field. Because the field is confined to a circular path inside the toroid, Ampère’s Law can be applied by choosing a circular loop inside the core, where the enclosed current determines the field strength and direction."
66,/image16.png,"This diagram shows a conducting medium arranged in three-dimensional space. The horizontal axis w represents the width of the conductor, the vertical axis h represents its height, and the z-axis points upward, indicating depth. First, the red boxes mark regions where electric current flows. Arrows on these boxes show the direction of current through the material in three dimensions. This means electric charges move through the conductor along the indicated paths, not just in a flat plane but through space. Second, the green circles and crosses represent moving charge carriers, such as electrons, showing whether they move toward or away from the viewer along the z-direction. This helps indicate how charges circulate within the conductor. Third, a magnetic field B is present around the current-carrying regions. As the charges move, they generate magnetic flux around the conductors. When moving charges interact with the magnetic field, a magnetic force can act on them, depending on the direction of motion and the field orientation. Together, the diagram illustrates how current flow in three dimensions produces magnetic flux and can lead to magnetic forces, linking charge motion, current direction, and magnetic field behavior in the system."
67,/image17.png,"The diagram illustrates a helical coil, showing its structure in a three-dimensional perspective. Key elements include the dimensions labeled as 𝑑 for diameter and 𝑧 indicating the axial direction, showing how the coil extends in space. There are also markings for 𝑁 representing the number of turns, and 𝑝 defined as the pitch, which is the distance between successive turns. A smaller pitch means the turns are closer together, which increases inductance by strengthening the magnetic field. The light blue color of the coil emphasizes its three-dimensionality and spiraling form."
68,/image18.png,"The illustration presents two distinct scenarios related to electromagnetic fields and their behavior concerning closed surfaces. On the left, the diagram represents the electric field around a positive charge (+Q), signifying that the net electric flux through the closed surface is equal to the total charge enclosed, as indicated by the expression Ψ = Q. Field lines leaving the surface correspond to positive charge, while field lines entering a surface would indicate negative charge. The field lines emanate outward from the charge, clearly showing the directional flow and density of the electric field. On the right, the illustration depicts a magnetic field around a closed surface with no enclosed magnetic charge (N and S denote a magnetic dipole), where the net magnetic flux is represented as Ψ = 0, indicating that magnetic field lines do not start or end within the surface. Magnetic field lines always form closed loops, entering and exiting the surface in equal amounts. Both diagrams utilize arrows to communicate the direction of field lines, emphasizing the divergence of electric fields and the absence of magnetic monopoles."
69,/image19.png,"The horizontal ground on which the weightlifter stands is labeled “y = 0.” The motion of the barbell lift at three positions is shown. In the final position, the barbell is directly above the lifter’s head with arms fully extended vertically. At this final position, the barbell is momentarily at rest, meaning it is not moving. In this position, two arrows point from the center of the barbell: the vector F₍weightlifter₎ points vertically upward along the vertical axis, and the vector w = F₍gravity₎ points vertically downward along the same axis. Because the barbell is not accelerating at this point, Newton’s First Law applies and the forces are balanced. The vertical distance between the ground and the bottom of the barbell is h, and the work done by the lifter in raising the barbell is stored as gravitational potential energy at this final height."
70,/image20.png,"Two opposite poles of two different magnets are placed near each other. The magnetic flux density B, marked in green, comes out of the north pole and enters the south pole. A conductor is placed between the opposite magnetic poles and carries a current I, marked in red. The magnetic force Fₘ acts downward, perpendicular to the magnetic flux density. The direction of this force follows the right-hand rule: the thumb points in the direction of the current, the fingers point in the direction of the magnetic field, and the palm shows the direction of the magnetic force."
71,/image21.png,"Two circular current-carrying loops, labeled 1 and 2, are placed close to each other and may be parallel or angled relative to one another. Each loop carries a current, with the direction of current flow shown along the circular paths. The current in loop 1 generates a magnetic field that spreads through space and passes through loop 2, linking the two loops magnetically. This interaction is the basis of mutual inductance, where a changing current in one loop can induce an effect in the other. A vector R₂₁ connects a small current element on loop 1 to a point on loop 2, pointing from the source of the magnetic field to where its influence is felt. Together, the loops and vector illustrate how magnetic fields produced by one circuit affect another nearby circuit, forming the physical foundation for inductive coupling."
72,/image22.png,"On the left side, a rectangular loop carrying a current I is placed in a magnetic flux density B, marked in blue. The length and width of the loop are labeled L and W, respectively. Magnetic forces act on the current-carrying sides of the loop, and opposite sides experience forces in opposite directions. On the right side, the rectangular loop is tilted so that its width makes an angle with the magnetic flux density B. The forces act perpendicular to B on each side of the loop, but because these forces point in different directions on opposite sides, they create a twisting effect, or torque. This torque tends to rotate the loop so that it aligns with the magnetic field, explaining how magnetic forces produce rotational motion in a current-carrying loop."
73,/image23.png,"The image represents a three-dimensional coordinate system illustrating spherical coordinates, characterized by the radius 𝑟, polar angle 𝜃, and azimuthal angle 𝜙. This coordinate system is commonly used to describe the magnetic field produced by a magnetic dipole, such as a bar magnet or a tiny current loop. In this context, the coordinates help specify the direction and strength of the magnetic field at different points around the dipole. The axes are labeled with the x-axis extending horizontally, the y-axis perpendicular to it, and the z-axis extending vertically, which is typically aligned with the dipole’s magnetic moment. The distance 𝑟 measures how far a point is from the center of the dipole, 𝜃 is the vertical angle measured down from the z-axis, and 𝜙 is the horizontal angle measured around the z-axis. A circular shape, marked in blue, signifies the plane in which the angles are defined, while dashed lines show how a point projects onto the coordinate axes. This system emphasizes the relationship between the spherical coordinates and their Cartesian counterparts."
74,/image24.png,"The nine panels together show the contraction and expansion of a piece of spring that is stretched and then released. The length of the spring is oriented horizontally. The left end of the spring is secured to a vertical surface. The right end is attached to a cube block. The panels are stacked one over the other, from a to i in the downward direction, with all instances of the left end of the spring vertically aligned. Three vertical, equidistant dashed lines are drawn through the nine panels. The line in the middle is labeled “x equals 0.” The line to the left is labeled “x equals negative A,” and the line to the right is labeled “x equals plus A.” In each panel, two forces are represented by arrows of two different lengths pointing horizontally from the center of the object. The long arrow has a length that equals the horizontal distance between one vertical dashed line and the next. The short arrow is a little more than half that length. The nine panels are as follows: In panel a, the center of the object is at x equals plus A. A long leftward arrow labeled “vector F” points to x equals 0. Here, “vector v equals 0.” Callout 1 reads, “Stretch the spring and release the block from rest at x equals plus A. In panel b, the right side of the object is at x equals plus A. Two short leftward arrow point to x equals 0: one labeled “vector F” and the other labeled “vector v.” Callout 2 reads, “The restoring force of the spring makes the block speed up.” In panel c, the center of the object is at x equals 0. A long leftward arrow labeled “vector v” points to x equals negative A. Here vector, “F equals 0.” Callout 3 reads, “The block is at maximum speed as it passes through the equilibrium position at x equals 0.” In panel d, the left side of the object is at x equals negative A. Two short arrows are shown: a rightward arrow labeled “vector F” and a leftward arrow labeled “vector v.” Callout 4 reads, “The block overshoots x equals 0; the restoring force then makes it slow down.” In panel e, the center of the object is at x equals negative A. A long rightward arrow labeled “vector F” points to A equals 0. Here, “vector v equals 0.” Callout 5 reads, “The block comes to rest momentarily at x equals negative A.” In panel f, the left side of the object is at x equals negative A. Two short rightward arrows point to A equals 0: one labeled “vector F” and the other labeled “vector v.” Callout 6 reads, “The restoring force again accelerates the block toward the equilibrium position.” In panel g, the center of the object is at x equals 0. A long rightward arrow labeled “vector v” points to x equals plus A. Here, “vector F equals 0.” Callout 7 reads, “The block again passes through the equilibrium position at x equals zero at maximum speed.” In panel h, the right side of the object is at x equals plus A. Two short arrows are shown: a rightward arrow labeled “vector v” and a leftward arrow labeled “vector F.” Callout 8 reads, “The block overshoots x equals 0 again; the restoring force again makes it slow down.” In panel i, the center of the object is at x equals plus A. A long leftward arrow labeled “vector F” points to x equals 0. Here, “vector v equals 0.” Callout 9 reads, “The block is again at rest at x equals plus A; the cycle now starts over.”"
75,/image25.png,"A magnet bar is placed in a magnetic field density B, marked in blue. The magnetic field applies forces at the north and south poles of the bar in opposite directions. These equal and opposite forces do not cancel but instead create a twisting effect, or torque, on the magnet. This torque causes the bar to rotate until it aligns with the direction of the applied magnetic field, explaining how magnetic dipoles orient themselves in an external field."
76,/image26.png,"The diagram shows the shapes of atomic orbitals as the orbital type changes from s to g. The 1s orbital is spherical, meaning the electron is equally likely to be found in all directions around the nucleus, showing complete symmetry. The 2p orbitals have a two-lobed, dumbbell shape, indicating that the electron is most likely found in two opposite regions, with the orientation changing depending on direction but keeping the same basic symmetry. The 3d orbitals are more complex, with shapes that include four lobes arranged around the nucleus or a flat disc with lobes above and below, showing that electrons occupy specific angular regions rather than all directions equally. The 4f orbitals have many lobes arranged in layered and circular patterns, indicating increased angular complexity and less overall symmetry. The 5g orbitals are the most complex, with multiple discs and many narrow lobes spread in layers, showing that the electron probability is divided among many distinct regions around the nucleus. Overall, the progression from s to g orbitals shows how electron distributions become more structured and directional as angular momentum increases, with each shape representing where an electron is most likely to be found rather than a fixed path."
77,/image27.png,"On the left side, magnetic dipoles in a small volume are shown with scattered directions when no external magnetic field is applied, meaning B = 0. In this case, thermal motion causes the dipoles to remain randomly oriented. On the right side, when an external magnetic field B is applied, the magnetic dipoles are oriented in the same direction as the field. Each dipole experiences a torque due to the magnetic field, which causes it to rotate and gradually align with the field over time."
78,/image28.png,"The image features two diagrams illustrating the concept of the cross product of two vectors, A and B. On the left, a hand gesture symbolizes the right-hand rule for determining the direction of the resultant vector, A × B, with the thumb pointing in the direction of the resultant and the fingers curling from vector A to vector B. The angle θ is marked, showing the orientation between the two vectors. On the right, a conical surface represents the magnitude of the cross product as the area of the parallelogram formed by A and B. The size of this area depends on the angle between the vectors: it increases as the angle opens and reaches its maximum when the vectors are perpendicular at 90 degrees. This ties the angle between the vectors directly to the magnitude of the cross product, alongside the use of the right-hand rule to determine direction."
79,/image29.png,"An S-shaped microstrip patch antenna is shown radiating electromagnetic waves. The shape of the patch controls how currents flow along the antenna, causing charges to oscillate back and forth along the S-shaped path. This oscillating current produces a time-varying electric field, which in turn generates a time-varying magnetic field. The electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic field, and both fields change together as the wave propagates. The direction of wave propagation is perpendicular to both fields, forming a transverse electromagnetic wave. The S-shape alters the current path length and distribution, which affects the radiation pattern, resonance, and directionality of the emitted waves. This illustrates how antenna geometry directly influences electromagnetic radiation behavior."
80,/image30.png,"This contour plot illustrates a three-dimensional surface represented in a two-dimensional format, showing the relationship between two variables, 𝑥₁ and 𝑥₂. The axes are labeled 𝑥₁ (horizontal) and 𝑥₂ (vertical), each ranging from approximately −3 to 3. The plot features several contour lines in blue, green, and red, with numeric labels such as 100, 250, and 500 indicating constant function values. The contours form a convex pattern resembling a parabolic surface, suggesting a local minimum at the origin where the function value is lowest. Gradient vectors at any point would point perpendicular to the contour lines and toward this minimum, indicating the direction of steepest descent. This shows that as 𝑥₁ and 𝑥₂ approach zero, the function value decreases, a key idea in optimization that helps explain convergence toward stable solutions."
81,/image31.png,"The 3D contour plot illustrates a scalar field represented by the variable V, shown across the x, y, and z axes. Contour lines mark locations where V has the same value, labeled as V₁, V₂, and V₃. The gradient vector ∇V points from lower values of V toward higher values, showing the direction of the steepest increase of the variable in space. Points P, P₁, and P₂ illustrate how moving in the direction of ∇V increases V most rapidly compared to other directions. Gradient vectors are perpendicular to the contour lines, which helps determine their direction visually. Where contour lines are closer together, the gradient is steeper, meaning V changes more rapidly over distance; where they are farther apart, the change is more gradual. This way of reading the plot is especially important for electric potential in space, where ∇V indicates the direction of the strongest change in potential and helps determine the associated electric field behavior."
82,/image32.png,"The image illustrates three distinct vector field representations centered around point P, showcasing different directional behaviors. The leftmost configuration reveals a radiating pattern, where arrows emanate outward from P, indicating a source-like behavior, similar to the electric field around a positive charge where field lines flow outward. The middle arrangement presents an inward-directed flow, with arrows converging toward P, representing a sink-like behavior, analogous to a negative charge where field lines flow inward. The rightmost depiction shows parallel arrows that suggest a uniform flow, indicating constant vector magnitude and direction without variation in intensity."
83,/image33.png,"The graph illustrates trends in functional CPU scaling over time, spanning from 2008 to 2030, with a logarithmic vertical axis labeled “Log (Functional CPU Scaling)” and a horizontal axis denoting “Year of 1st Production.” The curves show different strategies used to improve CPU performance as traditional transistor scaling slows. Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) refers to improving performance by optimizing circuit design, layout, and architecture within a given technology node, while System Technology Co-Optimization (STCO) goes further by co-developing the chip together with packaging, memory, and system-level technologies. Key milestones such as 14 nm and 7 nm mark points where shrinking transistor sizes alone provided diminishing returns due to physical and economic limits. The green line highlights a shift away from relying only on smaller transistors toward design-based and system-level solutions, showing how DTCO helps recover performance gains even when scaling slows. This trend explains why performance continues to improve despite the limits of traditional Moore’s-law scaling: innovation increasingly comes from smarter design choices and system integration rather than transistor size reduction alone."
84,/image34.png,"The chart shows how semiconductor manufacturing has evolved from 1970 to 2020 by tracking node size, wafer size, and de-magnification ratios. Over time, node sizes steadily decrease, meaning transistors become smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient, which improves chip performance while reducing power consumption. At the same time, wafer sizes increase, allowing manufacturers to produce more chips on a single wafer, which boosts production capacity and lowers cost per chip. The chart also shows increasing de-magnification ratios showing a transition from 1:1 to 4:1, which indicate how lithography systems shrink circuit patterns when printing them onto larger wafers, enabling very small features to be manufactured accurately. These trends explain how the industry continues to improve performance and efficiency by combining smaller transistors, larger wafers, and advanced patterning techniques."
85,/image35.png,"The image consists of two graphs representing spectral irradiance over different wavelength ranges, with both displaying spectral parts labeled accordingly. The left graph illustrates the spectral irradiance in nanometers, highlighting a sharp peak around the visible spectrum (approximately 400–700 nm) while tapering off towards the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) ends. This peak occurs because the Sun emits most of its energy at visible wavelengths due to its surface temperature. The right graph features a broader spectral range, incorporating an expanded view from UV to near-infrared wavelengths, with color coding indicating different spectral regions such as UV, visible, and IR (including UVA and UVB). The dominant colors in the visible range create a vivid rainbow effect, emphasizing the intensity of solar irradiance at these wavelengths. Both graphs reveal a notable decrease in intensity beyond the visible spectrum, indicating a significant decline in spectral irradiance as it moves into the infrared and ultraviolet ranges, which has implications for understanding energy distribution and environmental impacts related to solar radiation."
86,/image36.png,"The illustration features a series of stylized diagrams that represent how waves behave as they pass through a narrow opening. The leftmost section shows waves propagating in straight, parallel lines, indicated by an arrow. As they reach a barrier with a slit in the middle, the waves pass through the opening. After passing through the slit, the waves bend outward and spread into a circular pattern. The slit acts as a secondary source of waves, emitting new wavefronts in all directions. This spreading is caused by diffraction, which occurs when waves pass through an opening comparable in size to their wavelength. The amount of spreading depends on the slit width and the wavelength: narrower slits or longer wavelengths produce more bending, while wider slits produce less. The right section illustrates this outward-radiating wave pattern, highlighting how diffraction changes wave direction and distribution after the slit."
87,/image37.png,"The diagram illustrates a lithography process, focusing on the differences between two exposure scenarios shown on the left and right sides. It consists of five key layers: the mask pattern at the top, followed by representations of the near-field and far-field light distributions, intensity at the resist, and the resulting transferred pattern. The mask pattern shows alternating regions of varying opacity. These opacity differences introduce phase shifts in the light, meaning some light waves are delayed relative to others. In the near-field and far-field regions, the light waves combine differently depending on their phase, creating areas of constructive interference, where waves add together and increase intensity, and destructive interference, where waves cancel out and reduce intensity. This behavior is shown by the solid and wavy lines, with orange and blue indicating different light fields. Phase shifting changes how the light waves overlap, sharpening intensity transitions at the resist. The green lines highlight these intensity variations at the resist layer. The transferred pattern at the bottom shows the final result, where sharper light intensity differences produce clearer, more accurate features in the resist. Overall, the diagram demonstrates how controlling phase through mask design improves pattern definition."
88,/image38.png,"The figure illustrates an experiment that uses an interferometer to study molecular properties. In the setup, a beam of particles or molecules is split into two paths, then recombined, producing an interference pattern that depends on the molecules’ mass and internal structure. By analyzing how the interference changes, information about the molecules can be extracted. The molecular structure shown represents one of the species passing through the interferometer. The histogram plots signal intensity versus mass, with peaks between 20,000 and 30,000 Da. Each peak corresponds to a different molecular species or structural variant, showing how individual molecules contribute to the measured data. Together, the interferometer and histogram demonstrate how interference patterns are used to distinguish and analyze molecules based on their mass and structure."
89,/image39.png,"The image presents a scatter plot of detector counts measured over time as a function of detector position in micrometers (µm). The data form a repeating pattern of peaks and low regions across the detector range. These peaks arise from constructive interference of waves scattered by C₆₀ molecules, creating a diffraction pattern rather than random fluctuations. The strongest peak near 0 µm corresponds to the highest constructive overlap of scattered waves, while the regularly spaced side peaks result from additional interference maxima. The spacing between peaks reflects the spacing and arrangement of the molecules, allowing information about the sample’s structure to be inferred. Overall, the plot demonstrates how diffraction patterns reveal underlying molecular order through wave interference."
90,/image40.png,"The representation showcases a scatter plot with a smooth curve fitted through the data points. The x-axis is labeled “Transverse displacement (nm)”, ranging from 0 to 1,000 nanometers, and the y-axis is marked “Norm counts,” extending up to 1.5. Blue dots indicate individual measured data points, while the black line shows a clear sinusoidal trend. This oscillating pattern arises from diffraction effects, where waves interfere constructively at some transverse positions and destructively at others. As the displacement changes, the relative phase of the waves shifts, producing alternating maxima and minima in the counts. The spacing of the peaks and valleys reveals information about the spacing or arrangement of features in the material causing the diffraction, making the pattern useful for probing underlying structure rather than just visualizing the data distribution."
91,/image41.png,"The scatter plot shows Macroscopicity versus year from 1980 to 2020. Macroscopicity measures how large, massive, or “macroscopic” a system can be while still exhibiting quantum behavior, so higher values indicate experiments that push quantum effects to larger scales rather than simply larger physical size. Over time, the increase in Macroscopicity, especially the higher values appearing after 2000, suggests scientific progress driven by improved experimental techniques, measurement precision, and data collection methods, rather than changes in scale alone. The highlighted outlier, shown as a red diamond, represents an exceptional experiment that significantly exceeds typical results for its time, making it important because it challenges existing limits and motivates further investigation into how macroscopic quantum effects can be achieved."
92,/image42.png,"The image shows several panels illustrating how different laser beam inputs change the resulting interference patterns inside a structured medium. Changing the laser configuration alters the spatial frequency components of the light, labeled kx and kz, which determine how the waves propagate and overlap. When these waves recombine, constructive interference occurs where the waves align, creating bright regions, while destructive interference occurs where waves cancel, producing dark regions. Each panel displays a different arrangement of bright and dark features because the laser input changes the relative values of  kx and kz. Together, the patterns demonstrate how controlling the laser’s spatial frequencies directly controls the interference behavior, linking the visual structures to underlying wave physics rather than just the beam shape."
93,/image43.png,"The illustration presents a series of horizontal lines representing the {10} crystallographic orientation, which is a specific plane in the crystal that defines how atoms are arranged within the material. The dots along each line indicate atomic positions in the lattice. The distance D marks the spacing between adjacent crystallographic planes, which plays a key role in determining material properties such as density, mechanical strength, and electrical conductivity. This diagram highlights how the regular, repeating arrangement of atoms and the spacing between planes influence the overall behavior of crystalline materials."
94,/image44.png,"The graph shows how the critical magnetic fields of a type-II superconductor change with temperature, plotted against the normalized temperature T/Tc. The lower critical field Bc₁ represents the magnetic field strength at which magnetic flux first begins to enter the material, marking the transition from perfect diamagnetism to the mixed (vortex) state. The upper critical field Bc₂ represents the maximum field at which superconductivity can exist; above this value, the material becomes normal. As the temperature approaches the critical temperature Tc, superconductivity weakens, causing both critical fields to decrease, especially Bc₂, which drops rapidly. This behavior reflects the reduced ability of the material to expel or sustain magnetic fields as thermal energy disrupts the superconducting state."
95,/image45.png,"The image is an STM (scanning tunneling microscope) image of NbSe₂ taken at 1.8 K under an applied magnetic field of 1 tesla, with a spatial scale of 6000 angstroms. The evenly spaced atomic lattice is visible in the background. Superimposed on this lattice are dark spots that form a regular pattern, representing vortex states in the superconductor. Each dark spot corresponds to a magnetic vortex, where the external magnetic field locally penetrates the material and superconductivity is suppressed at the vortex core. Around each vortex, tiny circulating supercurrents flow, allowing the superconductor to accommodate the magnetic field while remaining superconducting elsewhere. This vortex pattern demonstrates how a type-II superconductor organizes itself under an applied magnetic field, balancing magnetic penetration with superconducting order."
96,/image46.png,"As the electron count increases from 20 to 4000, a clear diffraction pattern made of interference fringes gradually emerges. At low electron counts, individual detection events appear scattered and random. As more electrons are recorded, bright regions form where electron waves interfere constructively, meaning their wave crests align and reinforce each other. Dark regions appear where destructive interference occurs, where wave crests and troughs cancel out. The gradual buildup of this pattern shows that each electron behaves like a wave as it travels, even though it is detected as a single particle. This experiment demonstrates the wave nature of electrons, a fundamental result of quantum mechanics, and shows how a well-defined interference pattern emerges from many individual quantum events."
97,/image47.png,"The diagram shows a double-slit experiment, where waves pass through two narrow slits and interfere at a detector located a distance L away. The angle φ represents the difference in path length from each slit to a point on the detector, which determines whether the waves arrive in phase or out of phase. Bright fringes appear where the path lengths differ by whole wavelengths, causing constructive interference, while dark fringes form where the waves cancel through destructive interference. Because the two slits act as coherent sources, this setup produces a stable interference pattern. The experiment demonstrates interference from two coherent wave sources and reveals the wave nature of particles such as photons or electrons, a key result in wave and quantum mechanics."
98,/image48.png,"The representation consists of two waveforms plotted against a horizontal axis labeled “Position” ranging from 0 to 10, with the vertical axis labeled “y” indicating amplitude. The top waveform is drawn in red, depicting a sinusoidal pattern with an amplitude A = 1 and a wavelength λ = 1.2, while the bottom waveform, shown in black, also has an amplitude A = 1 but with a shorter wavelength λ = 1.0. A shorter wavelength means more wave cycles fit into the same spatial distance, which corresponds to a higher frequency. This is why the lower graph shows tighter oscillations compared to the wider spacing of peaks in the top graph. The inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency is a fundamental concept in physics and engineering, helping explain how waves behave in systems ranging from sound and light to signals and electromagnetic radiation."
99,/image49.png,"The depiction consists of two line graphs representing wave functions over a common horizontal axis labeled “Position” ranging from 0 to 10. The top graph shows a single blue sine wave oscillating between 0 and 2, illustrating a simple periodic wave. The lower graph presents two input waves, a red sine wave and a black sine wave, that oscillate out of phase with each other representing individual wave inputs. When waves overlap, superposition occurs, meaning their amplitudes add together at each point. Where the peaks of the waves align, they reinforce each other, producing constructive interference, and where a peak aligns with a trough, they partially or fully cancel, producing destructive interference. The vertical axis labeled “Sum” shows the result of adding the two waves together point by point. The combined waveform demonstrates how complex wave patterns can form from simpler waves, highlighting a key principle of wave physics that applies to sound, light, and other wave phenomena."
100,/image50.png,"The graph illustrates a mathematical function representing wave amplitudes relative to wave numbers. The x-axis, labeled “Wave number, k,” spans from 0 to 1.4, while the y-axis, marked “Individual Wave Amplitude,” ranges from 0 to 1. The curve, depicted in black, rises sharply to a peak at around k = 1 and then declines, forming a Gaussian distribution centered at this value. This indicates that k = 1 is the most probable wave number in the wave packet, meaning most of the wave components cluster around this value. The solid black dots align closely with the curve, emphasizing how well the function represents the distribution of wave components. Physically, this graph represents the distribution of wave numbers that make up a localized wave packet. The equation  𝑃(𝑘)=𝑒−100(𝑘−1)2/2 shows how tightly the wave numbers are grouped around the central value. The width of the Gaussian reflects the spread in wave number (Δk), which is directly related to uncertainty in the packet’s position in space. A narrower spread in k corresponds to a more uncertain position, while a wider spread leads to better spatial localization. This relationship connects the graph to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and explains how localized waves arise from a range of wave numbers in real physical systems."

(a) Action-at-a-distance: a gray sphere at the top directly influences another object below via a single straight red arrow, implying an instantaneous force acting across empty space with no intermediary. (b) Field model: a gray source sphere produces an influence that extends into the surrounding space (indicated by the arrow originating from the source and acting through the region), representing a field that mediates the interaction rather than direct contact."

A fixed origin O is shown at lower left, with a position vector R pointing to a reference point O′ inside the body. From O′, a relative position vector rᵢ points to a particle P on the body, marked in red. The absolute position vector Rᵢ runs from O directly to P. The vectors emphasize the decomposition of a particle’s position into a reference point plus a relative displacement, as used when describing angular velocity and rotational motion."
103,/angularMomentumQuantized.png,"This diagram illustrates a key idea from quantum mechanics: while the total angular momentum 𝐿 of a system has a fixed magnitude, its orientation in space is restricted. Only certain discrete values of the 𝑧-component,  𝐿𝑧=𝑚, are allowed, where  𝑚 is an integer. As a result, the angular momentum vector cannot point in arbitrary directions; instead, it occupies specific cones around the  𝑧-axis. The dashed circular paths represent precession of  𝐿 about the measurement axis. This quantization has no classical analog and reflects the fundamental role of measurement and symmetry in quantum systems, underpinning phenomena such as atomic spectra and magnetic resonance."
104,/conicalPendulum.png,"This diagram illustrates how circular motion can arise from a balance of forces. In a conical pendulum, the tension in the string splits into two components: the vertical component balances the weight 𝑚𝑔, keeping the mass at a constant height, while the horizontal component provides the centripetal force required for circular motion. Unlike a simple pendulum that swings back and forth, the mass here moves at constant speed in a circle, tracing out a cone in space. The angle 𝜃, radius 𝑟, and height ℎ, are directly related to the speed of the mass, showing how geometry and force balance determine rotational motion in classical mechanics."
105,/electricField.png,"Electric field diagram showing two opposite point charges, with a red dot on the left representing a positive charge and a blue dot on the right representing a negative charge. Gray field lines originate at the positive charge and curve through space to terminate at the negative charge, with arrows indicating the direction a positive test charge would move. The lines are more densely packed near the charges, indicating stronger electric fields in those regions, and spread out farther away where the field is weaker. This visualization emphasizes that electric forces are mediated by an electric field filling the surrounding space, not by direct contact between charges, and illustrates how the field’s direction and strength determine the motion and interaction of charged particles."
106,/electricField2.png,"Electric field diagram showing two identical positive point charges, represented by red dots positioned symmetrically along a horizontal line. Gray electric field lines radiate outward from each charge, with arrows indicating the direction of the field away from the charges. Between the two charges, the field lines curve away from the center rather than connecting, illustrating a region where the electric fields from each charge oppose one another and partially cancel. The symmetry of the pattern highlights that like charges repel, and the absence of field lines crossing the midpoint emphasizes the existence of a point (or region) of zero net electric field. This diagram reinforces the idea that electric fields superpose vectorially and that the resulting field geometry directly reflects the nature and arrangement of the source charges."

The electric field 𝐸 is shown in red, oscillating sinusoidally in the vertical direction within the plane of the drawing, while the magnetic field 𝐵 is shown in blue, oscillating in an orthogonal plane perpendicular to the electric field. The red and blue waves are in phase, meaning their peaks and troughs occur at the same positions along 𝑧. A horizontal bracket labeled 𝜆 marks the wavelength, the distance between successive peaks of the fields. The diagram illustrates that electromagnetic waves consist of mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields that oscillate together and propagate through space without a material medium, with the direction of propagation given by the cross product 𝐸×𝐵."

A positively charged object A (blue, marked with plus signs) is placed at the center of a hollow conducting shell B (yellow), which is connected to ground. Negative charges appear on the inner surface of the conductor, while excess charge flows to ground, leaving the outer surface electrically neutral. A separate object C outside the shell experiences no influence from the charge inside, showing that the electric field within the conducting material is zero. This diagram demonstrates how conductors redistribute charge to cancel internal electric fields, explaining why sensitive equipment can be shielded from external electric influences using grounded conductive enclosures (Faraday cages)."

A signal enters from the left and passes through a summing junction (marked with a plus sign), then splits into two paths. The upper (forward) path includes a gain block labeled 0.5 followed by a block labeled 𝑠, representing system dynamics in the Laplace domain. The signal then reaches a second summing junction on the right, producing the system output. From this output, a feedback path loops downward and back to the first summing junction, passing through a gain block labeled  𝛼 and an integrator block labeled 1/𝑠. The diagram illustrates how feedback modifies system behavior: the integrator introduces memory and accumulation over time, while the gains scale the signals. Overall, the circuit represents a closed-loop system where the output influences the input, a key idea in control theory used to improve stability, accuracy, and dynamic response."

112,/pulleySystem.png,"Free-body diagram of a pulley system with a mass 𝑀 suspended from a rope passing over a pulley. The pulley experiences an upward support force labeled 𝐹𝑇 at its axle, while two downward tension forces, 𝑇1 and 𝑇2, act on either side of the rope where it contacts the pulley. The mass 𝑀 hangs below, pulling downward due to gravity. This diagram highlights how tension forces act on the pulley from both rope segments and how the net upward force at the support balances these tensions, illustrating force transmission and equilibrium in ideal pulley systems."

A light-blue circular region represents the dielectric material, while red field lines depict the electric field passing through and around it. Far from the sphere, the field lines are straight and evenly spaced, indicating a uniform field. As the field enters the dielectric, the lines bend and become distorted, showing how the material polarizes in response to the applied field. This distortion reflects the alignment of bound charges within the dielectric, which partially oppose the external field and reduce its strength inside the sphere. The diagram illustrates a key concept in electromagnetism: dielectric materials do not block electric fields like conductors, but instead modify the field through polarization, altering the field distribution both inside and around the object."

At the top, a three-bit unsigned number is shown, where input bits 𝑧2, 𝑧1, and 𝑧0 are applied to a full adder with inputs 𝑥, 𝑦, and carry-in 𝑐_𝑖𝑛. The full adder produces a sum bit 𝑠 and a carry-out 𝑐_𝑜𝑢𝑡, and together these signals represent the binary addition result for that stage. The lower portion generalizes this idea to a six-bit unsigned number (𝑧0,𝑧1,𝑧2,𝑧3,𝑧4,𝑧5). The bits are divided into groups and processed by multiple full adders operating in parallel and in sequence. Intermediate sum outputs 𝑠1 and 𝑠2, along with carry signals 𝑐_𝑜𝑢𝑡1 and 𝑐_𝑜𝑢𝑡2, are passed into a larger 2-bit adder built from two additional full adders. Carry signals propagate through the network, ultimately producing final result bits 𝑅1 and 𝑅2 and a final carry-out that indicates overflow. This diagram emphasizes a foundational principle of digital system design: complex arithmetic operations are constructed by systematically connecting simple, well-defined components.

Dotted trendlines are drawn through each set of points, with equations labeled above them; the slope of each line represents the effective resistance of that circuit. Circuit 2 has the steepest slope, meaning it has the highest resistance (a small increase in current requires a large increase in voltage), while Circuit 4 has the shallowest slope, indicating the lowest resistance. Circuits 1 and 3 fall between these extremes. The small intercept values near zero show minimal offset or measurement error. Overall, the graph illustrates how different circuit resistances affect the voltage required to drive a given current, reinforcing the idea that resistance determines the proportionality between voltage and current in linear, resistive systems."

The data form a repeating, jagged pattern rather than a smooth curve. Sharp peaks occur at the noble gases—labeled Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, and Radon—indicating very high ionization energies due to their stable, filled electron shells. Immediately after each peak, the ionization energy drops sharply at the alkali metals (not labeled), reflecting how easily a single outer electron can be removed when a new shell begins. Within each period, ionization energy generally increases as atomic number increases, due to increasing nuclear charge pulling electrons more tightly toward the nucleus, with small dips caused by electron shielding and subshell effects.

Two sets of experimental data are shown for pressures P = 2.5 and P = 2.7, each plotted with data points and small error bars, along with corresponding smooth curves representing ideal gas law predictions at those pressures. For both pressures, density decreases as temperature increases, illustrating the inverse relationship between temperature and density for a gas when pressure is held approximately constant. At every temperature, the curve for P = 2.7 lies above the curve for P = 2.5, indicating that higher pressure results in a higher density at the same temperature, consistent with thermodynamic expectations. The ideal gas law prediction curves follow the same downward trend and remain close to the measured data, showing good agreement between theory and experiment. Small deviations between the measured points and the ideal curves suggest minor non-ideal effects or experimental uncertainty, but the overall behavior strongly supports the ideal gas model. The graph visually reinforces the physical principle that increasing temperature causes gas particles to spread out, reducing density, while increasing pressure compresses the gas and increases density."
133,/vectorAddition2.png,"This diagram illustrates vector addition of two forces using a head-to-tail construction and their resulting force. The black vectors F₁ and F₂ are drawn sequentially: F₁ acts at an angle θ₂ above the horizontal baseline, and F₂ begins at the head of F₁, rising steeply with its own orientation defined by angle θ₃. The grey diagonal vector Fᵣ represents the resultant force, drawn from the tail of F₁ directly to the head of F₂, showing the net effect of the two forces acting together. Several angles are labeled to clarify the geometry: φ measures the inclination of the resultant relative to the horizontal, θ₁ shows the angle between Fᵣ and F₁, and θ₂ and θ₃ describe the orientations of F₁ and F₂, respectively. Educationally, the figure emphasizes that vector addition depends on both magnitude and direction, not just size, and that the resultant force can be found geometrically or analytically using trigonometry or component methods. This construction is commonly used in statics and dynamics to analyze systems where multiple forces act simultaneously on an object."
134,/inertiaCylinder.png,"This diagram shows a thick (hollow) cylinder used to illustrate how moment of inertia depends on mass distribution relative to the axis of rotation. The cylinder has height h and rotates about its central z-axis, indicated by the vertical arrow. The inner radius r₁ and outer radius r₂ define the hollow region, with dashed vertical lines showing the cylindrical boundaries that contain the material. Physically, this figure emphasizes that rotational inertia is not determined solely by total mass, but by how far that mass lies from the rotation axis: material closer to r₂ contributes more strongly than material near r₁. This is why a thick or hollow cylinder resists changes in rotational motion more than a solid cylinder of the same mass concentrated near the center. In mechanics, this geometry leads directly to the moment of inertia expression 𝐼=1/2*𝑀(𝑟*(2/1)+𝑟*(2/2)) for a uniform thick cylinder, making the diagram especially useful for understanding angular acceleration, rotational kinetic energy, and real-world systems like flywheels, pipes, and rotating drums."
135,/magneticFlux.png,"This diagram illustrates magnetic flux through a single current-carrying loop placed in an external magnetic field. The green curved lines represent the magnetic field B, passing through the loop, while the brown oval shows the conducting coil that bounds the surface Σ. The red arrow labeled i indicates the direction of the electric current flowing around the loop, which sets the orientation of the surface normal n (blue arrow) according to the right-hand rule. The magnetic flux Φ through the loop is determined by how much of the magnetic field penetrates the enclosed surface and by the angle between the field and the normal vector, expressed mathematically as Φ=∫B⋅dA. Educationally, the diagram highlights that flux is maximized when the magnetic field is aligned with n and reduced when the field is tilted or partially bypasses the surface. This concept is fundamental to electromagnetic induction, explaining how changing magnetic flux through a coil generates an induced voltage, as described by Faraday’s law, and underpins technologies such as generators, transformers, and inductive sensors."
136,/magneticFlux2.png,"This diagram depicts magnetic flux linking two separate current-carrying coils, illustrating the principle of mutual inductance. The two brown loops, labeled Γ₁ and Γ₂, bound the surfaces Σ₁ and Σ₂, shown in green, with their corresponding outward normal vectors n₁ and n₂ indicated in blue. Currents i₁ and i₂ flow around each loop, establishing magnetic fields whose field lines (green curves) pass through both surfaces. The key idea shown is that the magnetic field produced by the current in one coil threads the surface of the other, creating a magnetic flux that couples the two circuits. Educationally, this illustrates how a changing current in coil Γ₁ alters the magnetic flux through Σ₂ and can induce an electromotive force in coil Γ₂, and vice versa, as described by Faraday’s law and quantified by the mutual inductance coefficient. This physical coupling underlies the operation of transformers, wireless power transfer, and many inductive sensing and communication systems."
137,/magneticCurrent.png,"This diagram illustrates the theoretical concept of magnetic current 𝑀, represented by circulating orange loops, producing an associated electric field 𝐸, shown by the green arrows pointing to the right. In this visualization, magnetic current is treated as if it were a flow of magnetic monopoles, even though such monopoles have not been observed in nature. The orientation of the electric field relative to the magnetic current follows a left-hand rule, emphasizing the symmetry that would exist between electricity and magnetism if magnetic charges were real. Educationally, this diagram is used to extend Maxwell’s equations into a symmetric form, helping students understand electromagnetic duality: just as electric currents generate magnetic fields, hypothetical magnetic currents would generate electric fields. This perspective is especially valuable in advanced electromagnetism, antenna theory, and computational modeling, where magnetic currents serve as powerful mathematical tools for analyzing radiation, boundary conditions, and wave propagation, even though they are not physically realized."
138,/kineticTheory.png,"This diagram illustrates the kinetic theory of gases, showing gas particles as small spheres moving randomly within a container, each leaving a faint trail that represents its recent motion. The particles travel in straight lines between collisions, changing direction only when they collide with other particles or the container walls. The variation in trail length and direction indicates that particles have a range of speeds and move isotropically, reflecting the microscopic origin of temperature as a measure of average kinetic energy. Educationally, the diagram emphasizes that gas pressure arises from countless elastic collisions with the container walls, while macroscopic properties like pressure, temperature, and volume emerge statistically from this chaotic microscopic motion. It also highlights key assumptions of the kinetic model: particles are far apart, intermolecular forces are negligible except during collisions, and total kinetic energy increases as temperature rises."
139,/circuitDiagram.png,"This circuit diagram shows a DC resistive network powered by a 5 V voltage source (V5), with an ammeter placed in series to measure the total circuit current. Starting from the source, current flows through a 100 Ω resistor (R9), then splits across a parallel branch consisting of R10 (200 Ω) and R11 (100 Ω), illustrating how parallel paths reduce equivalent resistance and divide current according to Ohm’s law. The currents recombine and pass through R12 (400 Ω) in series before entering a second, more complex parallel network made up of R13 (300 Ω), R14 (200 Ω), and R15 (100 Ω), which further demonstrates current division and equivalent resistance in multi-branch systems. The return path connects back to ground, completing the loop. Educationally, this diagram reinforces key circuit-analysis concepts such as series–parallel reduction, Kirchhoff’s current and voltage laws, and the relationship between resistance and current distribution. It also highlights how the ammeter must be placed in series to correctly measure total current and how real circuits combine multiple resistor configurations to control voltage drops and power dissipation."
140,/circuitDiagram3.png,"This diagram shows a DC parallel-resistor circuit powered by a 10 V voltage source (V4), with an ammeter (AM4) placed in series to measure the total current drawn from the source. After leaving the positive terminal, current flows through the ammeter and then reaches a junction where it splits into three parallel branches containing resistors R6 (164 Ω), R7 (264 Ω), and R8 (364 Ω). Because these resistors are connected in parallel, each branch experiences the same voltage drop of 10 V, while the current divides among the branches according to their resistance values, with the smallest resistor carrying the largest share of current. The individual branch currents recombine at the lower node and return to ground, completing the circuit. Educationally, this diagram reinforces key ideas from Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s current law: parallel connections reduce the equivalent resistance of the circuit, increase the total current drawn from the source, and require that the sum of the branch currents equals the current measured by the ammeter."
141,/circuitDiagram4.png,"This diagram shows a DC RC circuit with a switch, illustrating charging and discharging behavior in a first-order system. A 5.64 V voltage source (V5) is connected to the circuit through a single-pole switch (SW2), which controls whether the circuit is energized. When the switch is closed, current flows from the source to a node that feeds a resistor R7 (6.64 Ω) and a capacitor C4 (1.64 µF) connected in parallel to ground. The resistor provides an immediate conduction path, while the capacitor initially behaves like a short circuit and begins to store electric charge. Over time, the capacitor voltage rises toward the supply voltage as the charging current decreases exponentially, governed by the RC time constant τ = R7·C4. When the switch is opened, the source is disconnected and the capacitor discharges through the resistor, releasing its stored energy as the voltage across C4 decays back toward zero. This circuit visually reinforces core concepts in transient analysis, including switch-controlled dynamics, energy storage in capacitors, and exponential voltage and current behavior in RC systems."
142,/astronomy1.png,"A nearly edge-on spiral galaxy stretches diagonally across the image against a dark background scattered with distant stars. The galaxy, NGC 4388, appears as a thin, elongated disk with a bright, dusty central region and mottled bands of dark brown dust and glowing pink and blue star-forming regions running along its length. Extending from the galaxy’s nucleus toward the lower-right side of the image is a faint but striking plume of glowing gas, appearing bluish and wispy as it billows away from the disk. This luminous outflow contrasts with the softer, pale halo surrounding the galaxy and reveals gas being stripped from NGC 4388 as it moves through the hot intracluster medium of the Virgo galaxy cluster, about 60 million light-years away. The glow of the gas is thought to be powered partly by energetic radiation from the galaxy’s central supermassive black hole and partly by shock waves farther from the disk. The image combines multiple wavelengths from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, highlighting both the galaxy’s structure and the extended ionized gas cloud that was not visible in earlier observations."
143,/astronomy2.png,"A grid of twelve small infrared images shows the same bright star observed in different wavelength bands by the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer on the James Webb Space Telescope. Each panel is labeled with a band identifier and wavelength, ranging from about 5 to 26 microns. In every image, a bright, roughly circular white-yellow spot marks the star HD 37122 against a dark red background, with a dashed cyan circle indicating a one–arcsecond radius around the star’s expected position. At shorter wavelengths, the star appears very bright and slightly extended, while at longer wavelengths it becomes fainter and more compact, eventually blending with a smoother orange glow caused by thermal emission from the telescope itself. Together, the panels demonstrate the image quality, spatial alignment, and wavelength coverage of the twelve MRS spectral bands used to create three-dimensional data cubes that combine imaging and spectroscopy."
144,/astronomy3.png,"A line graph compares mid-infrared spectra from two space telescopes across wavelengths from about 9.4 to 9.8 micrometers, with intensity on the vertical axis and wavelength on the horizontal axis. A red curve labeled “Webb MIRI-MRS” shows finely detailed structure, including a very tall, narrow spike near 9.65 micrometers and a smaller nearby feature, demonstrating the high spectral resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope’s Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer. In contrast, a blue curve labeled “Spitzer IRS” traces a smoother, broader peak over the same wavelength range, reflecting the lower spectral resolution of the earlier Spitzer Space Telescope. The sharp red emission feature corresponds to molecular hydrogen emission from the active galactic nucleus of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 6552, while the comparison highlights how Webb’s MRS can resolve closely spaced atomic and molecular features that appear blended in lower-resolution data."
145,/forceTime.png,"Three stacked graphs illustrate how energy is added to a swinging motion through an external driving force, using the example of pushing a child on a swing. In the top graph, position 𝑥 is plotted versus time 𝑡, showing oscillations that start small and gradually grow in amplitude, representing how repeated, well-timed pushes add more and more energy to the child’s motion. The middle graph shows force 𝐹 versus time 𝑡 for a fairly realistic driving force: a sequence of short, periodic pulses that correspond to brief pushes applied at regular intervals, such as when a person pushes the swing at the right moment each cycle. The bottom graph also plots force 𝐹 versus time 𝑡, but here the force is represented as a smooth sinusoidal wave. This simplified driving force is less realistic physically, since real pushes are brief rather than continuous, but it is mathematically convenient and captures the essential idea of a periodic force driving the oscillation and transferring energy into the system."
146,/springWave.png,"A black-and-white composite image shows three vertical panels of sequential frames illustrating wave pulses moving along a stretched spring. Each panel represents a different wave interaction, captured from a filmed experiment in which one end of the spring was shaken by hand and individual frames were selected to show the motion over time. In panel 1 (left), a single wave pulse travels steadily to the left along the spring. The spring’s coils form a localized bulge that moves frame by frame while the rest of the spring remains nearly straight, showing the propagation of a single pulse. In panel 2 (center), two positive pulses approach each other from opposite directions. As they collide, the spring’s displacement increases where the pulses overlap, demonstrating superposition: the combined pulse has a larger amplitude during the overlap before the pulses pass through each other and continue on unchanged. In panel 3 (right), a positive pulse and a negative pulse collide. When they overlap, the upward and downward displacements partially cancel, producing a reduced or nearly flat displacement at the point of superposition. Afterward, each pulse continues traveling in its original direction, illustrating destructive superposition."
147,/waterWave.png,"A black-and-white experimental photograph compares the wavelengths of linear and circular water waves in a ripple tank. The image is split into two panels. In the left panel, a set of straight, evenly spaced bright and dark vertical bands represents linear water waves moving across the surface. The uniform spacing between the bands indicates a constant wavelength as the wave fronts propagate in parallel lines. A small symbol marks the wavelength measured between adjacent wave crests. In the right panel, circular water waves spread outward from a point source at the center of the tank, forming a series of concentric bright and dark rings. Each ring corresponds to a wave crest or trough, and the spacing between successive rings shows the wavelength of the circular waves. A pointer highlights one ring spacing to indicate how the wavelength is measured radially."
148,/dopplerEffect.png,"A black-and-white ripple-tank photograph illustrates the Doppler effect for water waves produced by a point source moving to the right across the surface. Concentric circular wave fronts are no longer evenly spaced. On the right side of the image, in the direction of motion, the wave crests are tightly packed, showing a shorter wavelength where waves are compressed ahead of the moving source. On the left side, behind the source, the wave crests are spread farther apart, indicating a longer wavelength for backward-going waves. The source itself is visible near the center-right, attached to a vertical rod that drives the motion. The asymmetric spacing of the rings visually demonstrates how motion of a wave source changes the observed wavelength, a hallmark of the Doppler effect."
149,/freewayTraffic.png,"Two simplified graphs illustrate a disturbance in freeway traffic as a function of position. The top graph plots velocity versus position, showing traffic moving at a higher, constant speed, then smoothly slowing down through a transition region, and finally continuing at a lower constant speed. The bottom graph plots excess density versus position, showing a localized rectangular spike where vehicle density is higher than normal, surrounded by regions of zero excess density. Together, the graphs show how a localized increase in car density corresponds to a drop in traffic speed, representing a traffic jam or congestion wave propagating along the freeway."

This apparent shift occurs because the brain assumes light travels in straight lines and traces the refracted rays backward into the water. Refraction depends on the indices of refraction of the two media and is governed by Snell’s law.

The image compares the behavior of a light ray crossing a boundary between two media with different refractive indices to a lawnmower moving from a sidewalk onto grass. In medium 1 (sidewalk), the mower moves faster, just as light travels faster in a medium with a lower refractive index. When the mower enters the grass (medium 2), one wheel slows down first, causing the mower to turn toward the perpendicular; similarly, when light enters a medium where it travels more slowly, it bends toward the normal. In the reverse situation, when moving from grass to sidewalk, the mower speeds up and turns away from the perpendicular, just as light bends away from the normal when it enters a faster medium. This analogy helps visualize how changes in wave speed cause refraction at a boundary and why the angle of refraction depends on the properties of the two media."

In panel (a), a single wavelength (pure λ) enters the prism and bends at each glass–air boundary due to the change in speed of light inside the glass. Because only one wavelength is present, the light emerges as a single ray with a new direction. In panel (b), white light enters the prism and is separated into its component colors. This occurs because the index of refraction of glass depends on wavelength, so different colors travel at different speeds inside the prism and bend by different amounts. Shorter wavelengths (violet, around 380 nm) experience a larger refractive index and bend more, while longer wavelengths (red, around 760 nm) bend less. This wavelength-dependent bending is called dispersion and explains phenomena such as rainbows and the separation of colors in optical instruments."

After entering the droplet, part of the light reflects off the inner back surface of the droplet. The reflected light then exits the droplet and is refracted a second time as it returns to air, increasing the separation of colors. As a result, red light exits at a larger angle relative to the incoming sunlight, while violet light exits at a smaller angle. When many droplets are present in the atmosphere, each droplet sends a specific color toward the observer, producing the circular arc of colors known as a rainbow."

In panel (a), a light ray travels from a medium with higher index of refraction (n1) into a medium with lower index of refraction (n2). Because light speeds up when entering the lower-index medium, the refracted ray bends away from the normal (the perpendicular to the surface). The angles of incidence and refraction are measured relative to this normal. In panel (b), the incident angle is increased until the refracted ray travels exactly along the boundary between the two media. This incident angle is called the critical angle, and at this angle the refracted angle is 90 degrees. In panel (c), the incident angle is greater than the critical angle, so refraction no longer occurs. Instead, all the light is reflected back into the original medium, a phenomenon known as total internal reflection. This effect is explained by Snell’s law and is the physical principle behind technologies such as fiber-optic cables and light guides."
298,/page0508_img000.png,"Demonstration of how total internal reflection causes diamonds to sparkle. Light entering the diamond from air slows down and bends toward the normal because diamond has a much higher index of refraction than air. When the light reaches an internal surface of the diamond at an angle greater than the critical angle, it cannot refract out into the air. Instead, it undergoes total internal reflection and is reflected entirely back into the diamond. Because the critical angle for a diamond–air boundary is very small, most light rays striking the internal faces are totally reflected multiple times. Diamond facets are carefully cut so that these internally reflected rays are directed back out through the top of the diamond toward the observer. This trapping and controlled release of light increases brightness, intensity, and sparkle, which is why diamonds appear exceptionally brilliant compared to other gemstones."

Light rays entering the binoculars travel into glass prisms, where they strike internal surfaces at angles greater than the critical angle. Instead of refracting out of the prism, the light undergoes total internal reflection, allowing it to be reflected efficiently without the energy loss that occurs with metallic mirrors. The prisms are arranged as corner reflectors, which reverse and reorient the image so it appears upright and correctly oriented to the viewer. This optical path also allows binoculars to be compact while maintaining a long effective light path for magnification. The same physical principle is used in fiber-optic cables, where light is guided through glass or plastic fibers by repeated total internal reflection, enabling high-speed transmission of data for internet, telephone, and cable television systems."
300,/page0509_img000.png,"optical fibers guide light using total internal reflection. Each fiber consists of a central core with a higher index of refraction (n₁) surrounded by cladding with a lower index of refraction (n₂). When light enters the core at a suitable angle, it strikes the core–cladding boundary at angles greater than the critical angle, causing total internal reflection rather than refraction out of the fiber. As a result, the light is confined within the core and can travel long distances with very little loss. Even when the fiber bends, the light continues to reflect internally and follows the curved path, allowing signals to propagate around corners. This principle enables fiber-optic communication systems, which transmit data as pulses of light for internet, telephone, and cable networks, offering high bandwidth, low signal loss, and immunity to electrical interference."

Ray 2 travels along the axis and passes straight through the lens with minimal deviation, while rays 1 and 3 bend toward the axis due to refraction. The enlarged view on the right shows how refraction occurs at each surface according to Snell’s law, with different angles of incidence and refraction as the light enters and exits the lens.

As a result, the image formed from white light appears spread out with different colors focusing at different positions, producing color fringes and changes in magnification. In part (b), a multiple-lens system is shown reducing chromatic aberration. White light rays pass through a combination of lenses made from different materials or shapes, causing the different colors to refract in a way that brings them closer to a common focus.

Light enters the eye through the cornea, which provides a large portion of the eye’s refractive power, and then passes through the aqueous humor to the adjustable lens.

Behind the lens, light travels through the vitreous humor before reaching the retina. The retina contains light-sensitive receptors, with the highest concentration located at the fovea, which is responsible for sharp central vision. The optic nerve exits the eye at the optic disc, creating a blind spot where no receptors are present. Other labeled structures include the iris, which controls the amount of light entering the eye, the ciliary fibers, which adjust the lens shape, and the sclera, which forms the protective outer layer of the eye.

This shows that when the opening is relatively wide, the wavefront spreads only slightly and continues mostly in its original direction. When the opening is narrow, comparable in size to the wavelength, the wave spreads out more strongly and forms curved wavefronts.

The vertical positions on the screen are labeled (y1) and (y2), corresponding to different angles and path differences. The intensity distribution on the screen is shown as a curve with a central maximum and a series of smaller maxima and minima on either side. The amplitude of the maxima decreases as the angle from the center increases, indicating that the bright fringes become dimmer farther from the central axis. A photograph of the actual interference pattern appears alongside the diagram, showing multiple bright and dark vertical fringes. The figure emphasizes that the double-slit pattern is modulated by diffraction, causing the overall intensity to fall off with increasing angle."

In part (a), monochromatic light passes through a single narrow slit of width (D). After the slit, the light spreads out due to diffraction and forms a pattern on a distant screen. The pattern consists of a bright central maximum and a series of smaller, dimmer maxima on either side. The central maximum is much more intense than the others and is noted to be several times higher than depicted in the drawing. In part (b), a schematic representation of the diffraction pattern on the screen is shown, with a wide, bright central band and thinner, less intense bright bands separated by dark regions. This illustrates how intensity decreases away from the center. In part (c), the intensity of the diffraction pattern is plotted as a function of (sin theta). The central maximum occurs at (sin theta = 0). Minima appear at values given by (sin theta = plus or minus lambda over D), (plus or minus 2 lambda over D), and (plus or minus 3 lambda over D), where (lambda) is the wavelength of the light.

Rays from the top and bottom edges of the slit travel to a point on the screen at an angle (theta) relative to the central axis. At certain angles, these rays interfere destructively, producing dark regions, or minima, in the diffraction pattern. The vertical distance from the center of the diffraction pattern to a minimum on the screen is labeled (y). The condition for destructive interference is given by the distance between the slits, multiplied by the sine of the observation angle, is equal to a whole-number multiple of the wavelength of the light (D sin theta = m lambda), where (lambda) is the wavelength of the light and (m) is a nonzero integer indicating the order of the minimum. For small angles, this condition can also be written as (D y / L = m lambda), the slit separation multiplied by the vertical distance to the bright or dark fringe, divided by the distance to the screen, equals an integer multiple of the wavelength. The diagram visually connects the geometric path difference to the mathematical expressions used to calculate the positions of dark fringes in a single-slit diffraction pattern."

Most directions experience destructive interference, while only certain angles produce intense maxima. In part (b), white light is incident on the diffraction grating. The central maximum appears white because all wavelengths overlap at zero angle. At larger angles, the first-order and second-order maxima separate the different wavelengths, producing rainbow-colored spectra on either side of the central maximum. Higher-order rainbows appear farther from the center, showing how a diffraction grating disperses white light into its component colors with increasing angular separation."

In part (b), a butterfly wing is shown with vivid blue coloration. The color does not come primarily from pigments, but from rows of microscopic reflective structures on the wing surface. These structures act like a reflection grating, causing constructive interference for certain wavelengths while canceling others.

The peaks are relatively wide, and the intensity between them does not drop completely to zero. In part (b), the diffraction grating pattern is shown. The maxima occur at the same angular positions as in the double-slit case for the same orders (m = 0, plus or minus 1), but the peaks are much narrower and taller. The regions between maxima are darker, indicating more complete destructive interference.

As the light strikes the grating, it is diffracted and separated into different wavelengths, which propagate at different angles due to constructive and destructive interference. Mirrors redirect the diffracted light toward a detector. Each wavelength follows a distinct path, producing a spread of colors at the detector that forms a spectrum. The diagram illustrates how diffraction enables the analysis of light by wavelength, allowing a spectroscope to identify the composition of a light source. At the same time, it highlights that diffraction is an inherent wave effect that can also limit image sharpness by spreading light rather than keeping it perfectly focused."

An oil droplet experiences a downward gravitational force (w) due to its weight and an upward electric force (Fe) when the electric field is applied. By adjusting the voltage across the plates, the electric force can be made to balance the weight of a droplet, allowing it to remain suspended. By knowing the mass of the oil droplet and the electric field strength required to balance it, the electric charge on the droplet can be calculated.
