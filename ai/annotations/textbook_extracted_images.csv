315,506,0,ai/data/page0506_img000.png,"Two panels are shown to demonstrate the refraction and dispersion of light by a glass prism. In panel (a), a single wavelength (pure λ) enters the prism and bends at each glass–air boundary due to the change in speed of light inside the glass. Because only one wavelength is present, the light emerges as a single ray with a new direction. In panel (b), white light enters the prism and is separated into its component colors. This occurs because the index of refraction of glass depends on wavelength, so different colors travel at different speeds inside the prism and bend by different amounts. Shorter wavelengths (violet, around 380 nm) experience a larger refractive index and bend more, while longer wavelengths (red, around 760 nm) bend less. This wavelength-dependent bending is called dispersion and explains phenomena such as rainbows and the separation of colors in optical instruments."
316,506,1,ai/data/page0506_img001.png,"Demonstration of how a rainbow is formed by sunlight interacting with a water droplet. Incoming sunlight enters the droplet and slows down, causing refraction at the air–water boundary. Because the index of refraction of water depends on wavelength, different colors bend by different amounts, with violet bending more than red. After entering the droplet, part of the light reflects off the inner back surface of the droplet. The reflected light then exits the droplet and is refracted a second time as it returns to air, increasing the separation of colors. As a result, red light exits at a larger angle relative to the incoming sunlight, while violet light exits at a smaller angle. When many droplets are present in the atmosphere, each droplet sends a specific color toward the observer, producing the circular arc of colors known as a rainbow."

In panel (a), a light ray travels from a medium with higher index of refraction (n1) into a medium with lower index of refraction (n2). Because light speeds up when entering the lower-index medium, the refracted ray bends away from the normal (the perpendicular to the surface). The angles of incidence and refraction are measured relative to this normal. In panel (b), the incident angle is increased until the refracted ray travels exactly along the boundary between the two media. This incident angle is called the critical angle, and at this angle the refracted angle is 90 degrees. In panel (c), the incident angle is greater than the critical angle, so refraction no longer occurs. Instead, all the light is reflected back into the original medium, a phenomenon known as total internal reflection. This effect is explained by Snell’s law and is the physical principle behind technologies such as fiber-optic cables and light guides."
318,508,0,ai/data/page0508_img000.png,"Demonstration of how total internal reflection causes diamonds to sparkle. Light entering the diamond from air slows down and bends toward the normal because diamond has a much higher index of refraction than air. When the light reaches an internal surface of the diamond at an angle greater than the critical angle, it cannot refract out into the air. Instead, it undergoes total internal reflection and is reflected entirely back into the diamond. Because the critical angle for a diamond–air boundary is very small, most light rays striking the internal faces are totally reflected multiple times. Diamond facets are carefully cut so that these internally reflected rays are directed back out through the top of the diamond toward the observer. This trapping and controlled release of light increases brightness, intensity, and sparkle, which is why diamonds appear exceptionally brilliant compared to other gemstones."

Light rays entering the binoculars travel into glass prisms, where they strike internal surfaces at angles greater than the critical angle. Instead of refracting out of the prism, the light undergoes total internal reflection, allowing it to be reflected efficiently without the energy loss that occurs with metallic mirrors. The prisms are arranged as corner reflectors, which reverse and reorient the image so it appears upright and correctly oriented to the viewer. This optical path also allows binoculars to be compact while maintaining a long effective light path for magnification. The same physical principle is used in fiber-optic cables, where light is guided through glass or plastic fibers by repeated total internal reflection, enabling high-speed transmission of data for internet, telephone, and cable television systems."
320,509,0,ai/data/page0509_img000.png,"optical fibers guide light using total internal reflection. Each fiber consists of a central core with a higher index of refraction (n₁) surrounded by cladding with a lower index of refraction (n₂). When light enters the core at a suitable angle, it strikes the core–cladding boundary at angles greater than the critical angle, causing total internal reflection rather than refraction out of the fiber. As a result, the light is confined within the core and can travel long distances with very little loss. Even when the fiber bends, the light continues to reflect internally and follows the curved path, allowing signals to propagate around corners. This principle enables fiber-optic communication systems, which transmit data as pulses of light for internet, telephone, and cable networks, offering high bandwidth, low signal loss, and immunity to electrical interference."

As a result, the image formed from white light appears spread out with different colors focusing at different positions, producing color fringes and changes in magnification. In part (b), a multiple-lens system is shown reducing chromatic aberration. White light rays pass through a combination of lenses made from different materials or shapes, causing the different colors to refract in a way that brings them closer to a common focus.

Behind the lens, light travels through the vitreous humor before reaching the retina. The retina contains light-sensitive receptors, with the highest concentration located at the fovea, which is responsible for sharp central vision. The optic nerve exits the eye at the optic disc, creating a blind spot where no receptors are present. Other labeled structures include the iris, which controls the amount of light entering the eye, the ciliary fibers, which adjust the lens shape, and the sclera, which forms the protective outer layer of the eye.

In this model, a small, dense, positively charged nucleus is located at the center of the atom, while electrons move around the nucleus in extended orbits. The diagram emphasizes that the nucleus is extremely small compared with the size of the electron orbits; its size is greatly exaggerated for visibility. Together, the two drawings illustrate the major shift in understanding atomic structure from a diffuse positive charge to a concentrated central nucleus."
360,566,0,ai/data/page0566_img000.png,"the setup of the oil-drop experiment used to measure the elementary electric charge. A fine mist of oil droplets is sprayed from an atomizer into the space between two horizontal metal plates. A bright light illuminates the region so individual oil droplets can be observed through a viewing telescope. The upper and lower plates are connected to a voltage source, creating a uniform electric field (E) between them. An oil droplet experiences a downward gravitational force (w) due to its weight and an upward electric force (Fe) when the electric field is applied. By adjusting the voltage across the plates, the electric force can be made to balance the weight of a droplet, allowing it to remain suspended. By knowing the mass of the oil droplet and the electric field strength required to balance it, the electric charge on the droplet can be calculated. Repeated measurements showed that the charges on the droplets always occurred in discrete multiples of a fundamental value, demonstrating that electric charge is quantized."

In part (b), the two attached pieces of tape are peeled off the surface together, and a finger is gently stroked along the nonsticky side of the top piece. This action helps redistribute electric charge on the tape. In part (c), the two pieces of tape are pulled apart by their handles.

The interaction between tapes changes as charge is transferred or rearranged during the process. In part (c), two pieces of tape are brought close together and are observed to move toward each other, indicating attraction.

An arrow across the top indicates increasing electrical conductivity from left to right. Materials are grouped into three broad categories: insulators, semiconductors, and conductors. On the left, insulators such as dry air, dry wood, rubber, and glass have very low ability to conduct charge, meaning electric charges do not move easily through them. In the middle, semiconductors such as silicon, germanium, and seawater have intermediate conducting ability that lies between insulators and conductors. On the right, conductors such as carbon, mercury, iron, aluminum, copper, and silver allow electric charge to move readily. Slashes on the arrow indicate that there are very large gaps in conductivity between these categories, but the scale is compressed to fit on the page.

The extra electrons repel one another and are free to move, so they spread out and redistribute themselves uniformly over the outer surface of the sphere. In part (b), an insulating sphere with excess negative charge is shown.

At contact, 25 electrons are transferred, and after separation, both spheres have equal charges of 75 excess electrons. In the bottom row, before contact, one metal sphere has an excess of 100 positive charges, represented as excess protons, and the other has an excess of 50 positive charges. During contact, 25 electrons move from the sphere with fewer excess protons to the sphere with more excess protons. After the transfer, both spheres are left with 75 excess protons.

Inside the column, a motor-driven belt moves continuously upward, carrying electric charge from the lower region to the top of the sphere. As the belt reaches the top, electrons are transferred onto the metallic sphere through a comb or brush, while the belt returns downward to repeat the process. The excess electrons deposited on the sphere spread out uniformly over its outer surface because they repel one another and are free to move within the conductor. This buildup of charge creates a large electric potential at the sphere. The diagram illustrates how Van de Graaff generators accumulate static electric charge and are used to demonstrate phenomena such as electric sparks, charge repulsion, and the effects of static electricity on nearby objects."

The diagram emphasizes that electric charge is quantized: the ink droplet’s net charge must be an integer multiple of the elementary charge. This principle allows the number of electrons added to the droplet to be determined by dividing the droplet’s total charge by the charge of a single electron, a key idea in understanding charge measurement and electric forces."

A second charged sphere is brought near the suspended sphere, causing an electrostatic force that twists the fiber. The angle of twist of the fiber is proportional to the applied torque, allowing the electric force between the spheres to be measured quantitatively. By varying the distance between the spheres and their charges, Coulomb demonstrated that the electric force depends on the product of the charges and varies inversely with the square of the distance between them, leading to Coulomb’s law."
