In panel (a), a light ray travels from a medium with higher index of refraction (n1) into a medium with lower index of refraction (n2). Because light speeds up when entering the lower-index medium, the refracted ray bends away from the normal (the perpendicular to the surface). The angles of incidence and refraction are measured relative to this normal. In panel (b), the incident angle is increased until the refracted ray travels exactly along the boundary between the two media. This incident angle is called the critical angle, and at this angle the refracted angle is 90 degrees. In panel (c), the incident angle is greater than the critical angle, so refraction no longer occurs. Instead, all the light is reflected back into the original medium, a phenomenon known as total internal reflection. This effect is explained by Snell’s law and is the physical principle behind technologies such as fiber-optic cables and light guides."
318,508,0,images/page0508_img000.png,"Demonstration of how total internal reflection causes diamonds to sparkle. Light entering the diamond from air slows down and bends toward the normal because diamond has a much higher index of refraction than air. When the light reaches an internal surface of the diamond at an angle greater than the critical angle, it cannot refract out into the air. Instead, it undergoes total internal reflection and is reflected entirely back into the diamond. Because the critical angle for a diamond–air boundary is very small, most light rays striking the internal faces are totally reflected multiple times. Diamond facets are carefully cut so that these internally reflected rays are directed back out through the top of the diamond toward the observer. This trapping and controlled release of light increases brightness, intensity, and sparkle, which is why diamonds appear exceptionally brilliant compared to other gemstones."

Light rays entering the binoculars travel into glass prisms, where they strike internal surfaces at angles greater than the critical angle. Instead of refracting out of the prism, the light undergoes total internal reflection, allowing it to be reflected efficiently without the energy loss that occurs with metallic mirrors. The prisms are arranged as corner reflectors, which reverse and reorient the image so it appears upright and correctly oriented to the viewer. This optical path also allows binoculars to be compact while maintaining a long effective light path for magnification. The same physical principle is used in fiber-optic cables, where light is guided through glass or plastic fibers by repeated total internal reflection, enabling high-speed transmission of data for internet, telephone, and cable television systems."
320,509,0,images/page0509_img000.png,"optical fibers guide light using total internal reflection. Each fiber consists of a central core with a higher index of refraction (n₁) surrounded by cladding with a lower index of refraction (n₂). When light enters the core at a suitable angle, it strikes the core–cladding boundary at angles greater than the critical angle, causing total internal reflection rather than refraction out of the fiber. As a result, the light is confined within the core and can travel long distances with very little loss. Even when the fiber bends, the light continues to reflect internally and follows the curved path, allowing signals to propagate around corners. This principle enables fiber-optic communication systems, which transmit data as pulses of light for internet, telephone, and cable networks, offering high bandwidth, low signal loss, and immunity to electrical interference."

Ray 2 travels along the axis and passes straight through the lens with minimal deviation, while rays 1 and 3 bend toward the axis due to refraction. The enlarged view on the right shows how refraction occurs at each surface according to Snell’s law, with different angles of incidence and refraction as the light enters and exits the lens.

As a result, the image formed from white light appears spread out with different colors focusing at different positions, producing color fringes and changes in magnification. In part (b), a multiple-lens system is shown reducing chromatic aberration. White light rays pass through a combination of lenses made from different materials or shapes, causing the different colors to refract in a way that brings them closer to a common focus.

Light enters the eye through the cornea, which provides a large portion of the eye’s refractive power, and then passes through the aqueous humor to the adjustable lens. The lens changes shape to focus light from objects at different distances, allowing a sharp real image to form on the retina. Behind the lens, light travels through the vitreous humor before reaching the retina. The retina contains light-sensitive receptors, with the highest concentration located at the fovea, which is responsible for sharp central vision. The optic nerve exits the eye at the optic disc, creating a blind spot where no receptors are present. Other labeled structures include the iris, which controls the amount of light entering the eye, the ciliary fibers, which adjust the lens shape, and the sclera, which forms the protective outer layer of the eye. The diagram emphasizes the importance of refractive indices in image formation, particularly the large change in refractive index at the cornea–air interface, which plays a key role in focusing light onto the retina."

Rays labeled (1) and (2) originate from one point on the object, while rays (3) and (4) originate from another point, demonstrating how different points on the object map to corresponding points on the retinal image.

The interaction between tapes changes as charge is transferred or rearranged during the process. In part (c), two pieces of tape are brought close together and are observed to move toward each other, indicating attraction.

In the middle, semiconductors such as silicon, germanium, and seawater have intermediate conducting ability that lies between insulators and conductors. On the right, conductors such as carbon, mercury, iron, aluminum, copper, and silver allow electric charge to move readily.

The excess electrons deposited on the sphere spread out uniformly over its outer surface because they repel one another and are free to move within the conductor. This buildup of charge creates a large electric potential at the sphere.

The diagram emphasizes that electric charge is quantized: the ink droplet’s net charge must be an integer multiple of the elementary charge.

The angle of twist of the fiber is proportional to the applied torque, allowing the electric force between the spheres to be measured quantitatively.

For most antiparticles, this means that they share the same properties as their original particles with the exception of their charge. This is why the positron can be considered a",288,516,
