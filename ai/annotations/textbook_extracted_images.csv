The image compares the behavior of a light ray crossing a boundary between two media with different refractive indices to a lawnmower moving from a sidewalk onto grass. In medium 1 (sidewalk), the mower moves faster, just as light travels faster in a medium with a lower refractive index. When the mower enters the grass (medium 2), one wheel slows down first, causing the mower to turn toward the perpendicular; similarly, when light enters a medium where it travels more slowly, it bends toward the normal. In the reverse situation, when moving from grass to sidewalk, the mower speeds up and turns away from the perpendicular, just as light bends away from the normal when it enters a faster medium. This analogy helps visualize how changes in wave speed cause refraction at a boundary and why the angle of refraction depends on the properties of the two media."

Because only one wavelength is present, the light emerges as a single ray with a new direction. In panel (b), white light enters the prism and is separated into its component colors. This occurs because the index of refraction of glass depends on wavelength, so different colors travel at different speeds inside the prism and bend by different amounts. Shorter wavelengths (violet, around 380 nm) experience a larger refractive index and bend more, while longer wavelengths (red, around 760 nm) bend less. This wavelength-dependent bending is called dispersion and explains phenomena such as rainbows and the separation of colors in optical instruments."

The reflected light then exits the droplet and is refracted a second time as it returns to air, increasing the separation of colors.

The angles of incidence and refraction are measured relative to this normal. In panel (b), the incident angle is increased until the refracted ray travels exactly along the boundary between the two media. This incident angle is called the critical angle, and at this angle the refracted angle is 90 degrees. In panel (c), the incident angle is greater than the critical angle, so refraction no longer occurs.

Light entering the diamond from air slows down and bends toward the normal because diamond has a much higher index of refraction than air. When the light reaches an internal surface of the diamond at an angle greater than the critical angle, it cannot refract out into the air. Instead, it undergoes total internal reflection and is reflected entirely back into the diamond. Because the critical angle for a diamond–air boundary is very small, most light rays striking the internal faces are totally reflected multiple times. Diamond facets are carefully cut so that these internally reflected rays are directed back out through the top of the diamond toward the observer. This trapping and controlled release of light increases brightness, intensity, and sparkle, which is why diamonds appear exceptionally brilliant compared to other gemstones."

Instead of refracting out of the prism, the light undergoes total internal reflection, allowing it to be reflected efficiently without the energy loss that occurs with metallic mirrors. The prisms are arranged as corner reflectors, which reverse and reorient the image so it appears upright and correctly oriented to the viewer. This optical path also allows binoculars to be compact while maintaining a long effective light path for magnification. The same physical principle is used in fiber-optic cables, where light is guided through glass or plastic fibers by repeated total internal reflection, enabling high-speed transmission of data for internet, telephone, and cable television systems."

Each fiber consists of a central core with a higher index of refraction (n₁) surrounded by cladding with a lower index of refraction (n₂). When light enters the core at a suitable angle, it strikes the core–cladding boundary at angles greater than the critical angle, causing total internal reflection rather than refraction out of the fiber. As a result, the light is confined within the core and can travel long distances with very little loss. Even when the fiber bends, the light continues to reflect internally and follows the curved path, allowing signals to propagate around corners. This principle enables fiber-optic communication systems, which transmit data as pulses of light for internet, telephone, and cable networks, offering high bandwidth, low signal loss, and immunity to electrical interference."

This experiment is analogous to Rutherford’s discovery of the small size of the nucleus by scattering α particles. High-energy electrons are used so that the probe wavelength is small enough to see details smaller than the proton.

While the colors of the individual quarks change, their flavors do not. Note that quark flavor may have any color. For instance, in Figure 23.13, the down quark has a red color and a green color. In other words, colors are not specific to a particle quark flavor. Hadrons and Leptons Particles can be revealingly grouped according to what forces they feel between them. Al",297,292,
