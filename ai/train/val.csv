94,C:\Users\nawaa\OneDrive\Desktop\capstoneAI\trainSplit\val_data\image44.png,"The graph shows how the critical magnetic fields of a type-II superconductor change with temperature, plotted against the normalized temperature T/Tc. The lower critical field Bc₁ represents the magnetic field strength at which magnetic flux first begins to enter the material, marking the transition from perfect diamagnetism to the mixed (vortex) state. The upper critical field Bc₂ represents the maximum field at which superconductivity can exist; above this value, the material becomes normal. As the temperature approaches the critical temperature Tc, superconductivity weakens, causing both critical fields to decrease, especially Bc₂, which drops rapidly. This behavior reflects the reduced ability of the material to expel or sustain magnetic fields as thermal energy disrupts the superconducting state."

91,C:\Users\nawaa\OneDrive\Desktop\capstoneAI\trainSplit\val_data\image41.png,"The scatter plot shows Macroscopicity versus year from 1980 to 2020. Macroscopicity measures how large, massive, or “macroscopic” a system can be while still exhibiting quantum behavior, so higher values indicate experiments that push quantum effects to larger scales rather than simply larger physical size. Over time, the increase in Macroscopicity, especially the higher values appearing after 2000, suggests scientific progress driven by improved experimental techniques, measurement precision, and data collection methods, rather than changes in scale alone. The highlighted outlier, shown as a red diamond, represents an exceptional experiment that significantly exceeds typical results for its time, making it important because it challenges existing limits and motivates further investigation into how macroscopic quantum effects can be achieved."

In part (a), a conducting sphere with excess negative charge is shown. The extra electrons repel one another and are free to move, so they spread out and redistribute themselves uniformly over the outer surface of the sphere. In part (b), an insulating sphere with excess negative charge is shown. Because electrons are not free to move within an insulator, the excess negative charge remains localized near where it was placed rather than spreading over the surface. The figure illustrates the key difference between conductors and insulators in how electric charge can move and redistribute."

Light from a source enters the instrument and travels toward a diffraction grating. As the light strikes the grating, it is diffracted and separated into different wavelengths, which propagate at different angles due to constructive and destructive interference. Mirrors redirect the diffracted light toward a detector. Each wavelength follows a distinct path, producing a spread of colors at the detector that forms a spectrum. The diagram illustrates how diffraction enables the analysis of light by wavelength, allowing a spectroscope to identify the composition of a light source. At the same time, it highlights that diffraction is an inherent wave effect that can also limit image sharpness by spreading light rather than keeping it perfectly focused."

The object is placed at a distance do from the mirror with height ho, while the image forms at distance di with height hi. Rays are drawn using standard construction rules: one ray travels parallel to the principal axis and reflects through the focal point F, another passes through the focal point and reflects parallel to the axis, and a third reflects symmetrically about the normal. These rays intersect to locate the image position and size. The focal length f characterizes the mirror’s curvature and determines how strongly it converges light. The relationships among do, di, and f are described by the mirror (lens) equation, which is used to predict image location and magnification in optical systems such as mirrors, lenses, telescopes, and cameras."

85,C:\Users\nawaa\OneDrive\Desktop\capstoneAI\trainSplit\val_data\image35.png,"The image consists of two graphs representing spectral irradiance over different wavelength ranges, with both displaying spectral parts labeled accordingly. The left graph illustrates the spectral irradiance in nanometers, highlighting a sharp peak around the visible spectrum (approximately 400–700 nm) while tapering off towards the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) ends. This peak occurs because the Sun emits most of its energy at visible wavelengths due to its surface temperature. The right graph features a broader spectral range, incorporating an expanded view from UV to near-infrared wavelengths, with color coding indicating different spectral regions such as UV, visible, and IR (including UVA and UVB). The dominant colors in the visible range create a vivid rainbow effect, emphasizing the intensity of solar irradiance at these wavelengths.

141,C:\Users\nawaa\OneDrive\Desktop\capstoneAI\trainSplit\val_data\circuitDiagram4.png,"This diagram shows a DC RC circuit with a switch, illustrating charging and discharging behavior in a first-order system. A 5.64 V voltage source (V5) is connected to the circuit through a single-pole switch (SW2), which controls whether the circuit is energized. When the switch is closed, current flows from the source to a node that feeds a resistor R7 (6.64 Ω) and a capacitor C4 (1.64 µF) connected in parallel to ground. The resistor provides an immediate conduction path, while the capacitor initially behaves like a short circuit and begins to store electric charge. Over time, the capacitor voltage rises toward the supply voltage as the charging current decreases exponentially, governed by the RC time constant τ = R7·C4. When the switch is opened, the source is disconnected and the capacitor discharges through the resistor, releasing its stored energy as the voltage across C4 decays back toward zero. This circuit visually reinforces core concepts in transient analysis, including switch-controlled dynamics, energy storage in capacitors, and exponential voltage and current behavior in RC systems."

In the middle, semiconductors such as silicon, germanium, and seawater have intermediate conducting ability that lies between insulators and conductors. On the right, conductors such as carbon, mercury, iron, aluminum, copper, and silver allow electric charge to move readily.

In this position, two arrows point from the center of the barbell: the vector F₍weightlifter₎ points vertically upward along the vertical axis, and the vector w = F₍gravity₎ points vertically downward along the same axis. Because the barbell is not accelerating at this point, Newton’s First Law applies and the forces are balanced.

Two sets of experimental data are shown for pressures P = 2.5 and P = 2.7, each plotted with data points and small error bars, along with corresponding smooth curves representing ideal gas law predictions at those pressures. For both pressures, density decreases as temperature increases, illustrating the inverse relationship between temperature and density for a gas when pressure is held approximately constant. At every temperature, the curve for P = 2.7 lies above the curve for P = 2.5, indicating that higher pressure results in a higher density at the same temperature, consistent with thermodynamic expectations. The ideal gas law prediction curves follow the same downward trend and remain close to the measured data, showing good agreement between theory and experiment. Small deviations between the measured points and the ideal curves suggest minor non-ideal effects or experimental uncertainty, but the overall behavior strongly supports the ideal gas model. The graph visually reinforces the physical principle that increasing temperature causes gas particles to spread out, reducing density, while increasing pressure compresses the gas and increases density."

The grey diagonal vector Fᵣ represents the resultant force, drawn from the tail of F₁ directly to the head of F₂, showing the net effect of the two forces acting together. Several angles are labeled to clarify the geometry: φ measures the inclination of the resultant relative to the horizontal, θ₁ shows the angle between Fᵣ and F₁, and θ₂ and θ₃ describe the orientations of F₁ and F₂, respectively. Educationally, the figure emphasizes that vector addition depends on both magnitude and direction, not just size, and that the resultant force can be found geometrically or analytically using trigonometry or component methods.

The bcc structure includes atoms at the cube corners and one atom at the center. This configuration, common in elements such as iron (Fe), vanadium (V), niobium (Nb), and chromium (Cr), supports efficient packing and strong metallic bonding, contributing to structural strength. The fcc structure places atoms at the cube corners and at the center of each face. This closely packed arrangement is found in metals such as aluminum (Al), nickel (Ni), silver (Ag), copper (Cu), and gold (Au). Its dense packing allows atoms to slide past one another more easily, which explains its high ductility and good electrical conductivity. The hexagonal lattice uses a hexagon-shaped repeating pattern with atoms arranged to maximize packing. This hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure appears in materials like titanium (Ti), zinc (Zn), magnesium (Mg), and cadmium (Cd). It has a coordination number of twelve, meaning each atom touches twelve neighboring atoms, leading to strong atomic bonding and high strength, but less ability to deform compared to fcc structures."

The particles travel in straight lines between collisions, changing direction only when they collide with other particles or the container walls. The variation in trail length and direction indicates that particles have a range of speeds and move isotropically, reflecting the microscopic origin of temperature as a measure of average kinetic energy. Educationally, the diagram emphasizes that gas pressure arises from countless elastic collisions with the container walls, while macroscopic properties like pressure, temperature, and volume emerge statistically from this chaotic microscopic motion. It also highlights key assumptions of the kinetic model: particles are far apart, intermolecular forces are negligible except during collisions, and total kinetic energy increases as temperature rises."

The diagram visually connects the geometric path difference to the mathematical expressions used to calculate the positions of dark fringes in a single-slit diffraction pattern."

The magnetic flux density B, marked in green, comes out of the north pole and enters the south pole. A conductor is placed between the opposite magnetic poles and carries a current I, marked in red. The magnetic force Fₘ acts downward, perpendicular to the magnetic flux density. The direction of this force follows the right-hand rule: the thumb points in the direction of the current, the fingers point in the direction of the magnetic field, and the palm shows the direction of the magnetic force."

305,C:\Users\nawaa\OneDrive\Desktop\capstoneAI\trainSplit\val_data\page0519_img000.png,"a compound microscope consisting of two lenses: an objective lens and an eyepiece. A small object of height (ho) is placed just beyond the focal point (Fo) of the objective lens at a distance (do). Rays from the object pass through the objective lens and form a real, inverted, and magnified first image of height (hi) at a distance (di). This first image lies near the focal point (Fe) of the eyepiece and serves as the object for the eyepiece lens. The eyepiece acts as a magnifying glass and produces a final virtual image of height (hi prime), which is magnified even further and viewed by the eye. The dashed backward extensions of the rays indicate the apparent position of the final image on the same side of the eyepiece as the object. Distances between lenses and images, including (do), (di), and (di prime), are labeled along the optical axis. The diagram emphasizes idealized ray behavior, while noting that real lenses introduce aberrations, which are distortions that cause images to deviate from the predictions of thin-lens ray diagrams."

Light rays from a bottle reflect off the flat mirror and enter the observer’s eye, obeying the law of reflection where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. The reflected rays diverge, but when traced backward as dashed lines, they appear to originate from a point behind the mirror, forming a virtual image. The diagram shows that the image distance di behind the mirror is equal to the object distance do in front of the mirror, explaining why flat mirrors produce upright that appear the same size as the object but cannot be projected onto a screen."

In panel (a), the rope oscillates in a vertical plane, representing vertically polarized waves that can pass through a vertical slit. In panel (b), the rope oscillates in a horizontal plane, representing horizontally polarized waves that are blocked by a vertical slit. The diagram illustrates that polarization describes the direction of oscillation perpendicular to the direction of wave travel, and that filters or slits only transmit waves polarized in the same direction, a principle that also applies to light waves."
