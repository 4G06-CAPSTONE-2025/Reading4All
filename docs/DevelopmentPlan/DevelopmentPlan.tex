\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Discord}: Our main method of communication between group members. It will be used to discuss detailed deliverable and any code questions. Additionally, group meetings will be hosted on discord. 
    \item \textbf{Instagram}: Our secondary method of communication between group members. It will be used to discuss less technical details and for any urgent messages that require a quicker response. 
    \item \textbf{Teams}: Our main method of communication with our Supervisor. We will utilize our group chat with our supervisor for any quick questions or updates. Online meetings with our supervisor will be hosted on teams.
    \item \textbf{GitHub}: The issues feature will be utilized to communicate any bugs observed and meeting attendance. Additionally, as a week to see what other team members are working on.
\end{itemize}


\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item\textbf{How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?}
	 We will be using git, branches and pull requests in order to divide work between group members and complete tasks concurrently. 
   Furthermore, we will follow a feature-branch based approach, our process will follow these steps:
   \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Branch Creation} Group member will create a branch from the develop branch for each feature they work on and follow this naming convention: \newline
    \textit{feature\_[contributorName]/D\#\_[featureDescription]} \newline
    Similarly, for bugs the following naming convention will be followed: \newline
   \textit{bug\_[contributorName]/D\#\_[bugDescription]} \newline
    Beyond feature branches, we will also have \textit{develop} and \textit{main} branches. The develop branch will be used to integrate different features and once
    tested, as well as reviewed by the majority of group members can be merged into main. 
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Pull Request} Once a group member is done working on their feature, they will open a pull request to merge into the develop branch. Group members will use the Github comment feature to connect their feature to any applicable issue numbers.
    \end{itemize}
	\item\textbf{Continuous Integration\ Continuous Development}
	
  For continuous integration (CI), we will be using Github actions to automatically trigger a project build and run unit tests 
  whenever a commit occurs or pull requests are opened. This ensures errors are discovered as early as possible and that the project remains in a working state during development. 

  \item \textbf{Managing issues}\newline
  We will utilize the capTemplate template issues for tracking attendance, peer review, supervisor, TA, and team meetings. Furthermore, issues that fall outside these categories will utilize the labels mentioned below to ensure they are easily understood and managed. 
  \item \textbf{Use of Labels:} \newline
  The team will utilize issue tags to help us organize ongoing work as well as work that needs to be completed. The tags will enable us to see the status of ongoing work and their respective priority. 
    The issue tags we will have available are:
     \begin{itemize} 
        \item Bug, feature, question, in-progress, review needed, changes needed, ready for merge, done, high priority, low priority, meeting, frontend, backend, feedback 
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Use of Checklists:} \newline
  The group will utilize the deliverable checklists to ensure our work meets the expectations. 
  We will also have checklists in the Pull Request templates to ensure that all required items are completed prior to merging. The checklist will include the following items: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Unit Tests Passed
    \item Coding Standard is followed 
    \item Code Compiles without errors
    \item Reviewed by 2 team members
  \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?
