\section{Team Meeting Plan}

The team will meet weekly on Tuesdays from 3:00pm to 4:00pm virtually on Discord or in person on campus if needed. 
The team will meet with the industry advisor biweekly on Thursdays from 2:30pm to 3:30pm. These meetings with the industry advisor will 
be conducted either online on Microsoft Teams or in person on campus. \\[1ex]
The meetings will be structured as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item An agenda prepared by the meeting chair (who rotates among team members each week) 
  will be made to use as a guide for the meeting.
	\item The team will go over any announcements or completed To-Dos from the previous week's 
  meeting if needed.
  \item Each member will present what they have worked on so far and ask the remaining group 
  members for feedback or any questions if needed.
  \item The team will discuss and document any decisions needed about the deliverables 
  or the project. 
  \item Any concerns/questions will be documented for the next team meeting or for the next 
  industry advisor meeting.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Discord}: Our main method of communication between group members. It will be used to discuss detailed deliverable and any code questions. Additionally, group meetings will be hosted on discord. 
    \item \textbf{Instagram}: Our secondary method of communication between group members. It will be used to discuss less technical details and for any urgent messages that require a quicker response. 
    \item \textbf{Teams}: Our main method of communication with our Supervisor. We will utilize our group chat with our supervisor for any quick questions or updates. Online meetings with our supervisor will be hosted on teams.
    \item \textbf{GitHub}: The issues feature will be utilized to communicate any bugs observed and meeting attendances. Additionally, as a way to see what feature each team member is working on and their progress. 
\end{itemize}



\section{Team Member Roles}

The team will work collaboratively to develop and refine this project. To ensure a clear 
division of tasks, each team member have been assigned roles that 
align with their areas of expertise and contribute to achieving the goals 
of this project. These roles will rotate throughout the year to prevent overspecialization
and to ensure that all members can gain experience and knowledge in 
every aspect of the project. \\[1ex]
The defined roles and responsibilities per team member is as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Fiza Sehar}: \textit{Developer, Documentation, Model Training Specialist} \\
	Fiza will be responsible for developing features and maintaining documentation for the 
  project. She will also be leading the model training for the project to ensure 
  efficient and accurate performance.
	\item \textbf{Dhruv Sardana}: \textit{Developer, Documentation, Full-Stack Specialist} \\
	Dhruv will work across both frontend and backend development, and in ensuring a 
  seamless integration and functionality. He will also support in writing documentation
  for this project. 
	\item \textbf{Nawaal Fatima}: \textit{Developer, Documentation, Data Specialist} \\
	Nawaal will also work on developing features with a 
  focus on data management, pre-processing, and analysis in this project. She 
  will also contribute in the documentation of the project.
	\item \textbf{Moly Mikhail}: \textit{Developer, Documentation, Backend Specialist} \\
	Moly will be handling the APIs, database management, and system logic focusing on 
  the backend of the project. She will also support in the documentation of the project.
	\item \textbf{Casey Francine Bulaclac}: \textit{Developer, Documentation, Frontend Specialist} \\
	Francine will be responsible for the design and implementation of the user interface, 
  ensuring correct usability and accessibility while assisting in the project 
  documentation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item\textbf{Git Workflow \newline}
	 We will be using git, branches and pull requests in order to divide work between group members and complete tasks concurrently. 
   Furthermore, we will follow a feature-branch based approach, our process will follow these steps:
   \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Step 1: Permanent Branches}: The project repository will have two permanent branches. 
   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Develop}: This branch will be used integrate different features and ensure that they work successfully together. Code can only be merged into the develop branch after being reviewed by one other team member who wasn't working on the feature. 
      \item \textbf{Main}: This branch will be used to maintain the most stable version of the application. Code in the develop branch can only merged into the main branch after its been extensively tested and been reviewed and approved by a majority of team members. 
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Step 2: Feature/Bug Branches} Group member will create a branch from the \texttt{develop} branch (after pulling the most recent changes) for each feature they work on. \newline
    \textbf{Naming Conventions:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Features: }\texttt{feature\_[contributorName]/D\#\_[featureDescription]} 
      \item \textbf{Bugs: }  \texttt{bug\_[contributorName]/D\#\_[bugDescription]}
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Step 3: Pull Request} Once a group member is done working on their feature, they will open a pull request to merge into the develop branch. Group members will use the Github comment feature to connect their feature to any applicable issue numbers. They will also assign a group member to review their code.
    \end{itemize}

	\item\textbf{Continuous Integration\ Continuous Development}
	
  For continuous integration (CI), we will be using Github actions to automatically trigger a project build and run unit tests 
  whenever a commit occurs or pull requests are opened. This ensures errors are discovered as early as possible and that the project remains in a working state during development. 

  \item \textbf{Use of Labels} \newline
  The team will utilize labels to help us organize ongoing work as well as work that needs to be completed. The tags will enable us to see the status of ongoing work and their respective priority. 
    The issue tags we will have available are:
     \begin{itemize} 
        \item Bug, feature, question, in-progress, review needed, changes needed, ready for merge, done, high priority, low priority, meeting, frontend, backend, feedback 
    \end{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Managing issues}\newline
  We will utilize the capTemplate template issues for tracking attendance, peer review, supervisor, TA, and team meetings. Furthermore, issues that fall outside these categories will utilize the blank issue and the labels mentioned above. \newline
  The issue will have a clear title, description and an owner to be responsible for the issue. This will ensure issues are easily identified and managed. Once an issue has been resolved, it will be linked to the PR containing the code, allowing the team to keep track of the issues status.
  \item \textbf{Use of Checklists} \newline
  The group will utilize the deliverable checklists to ensure our work meets the expectations. 
  We will also have checklists in the Pull Request templates to ensure that all required items are completed prior to merging. The checklist will include the following items: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Unit Tests Passed
    \item Coding Standard is followed 
    \item Code Compiles without errors
    \item Reviewed by 2 team members
  \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\section{Coding Standard}
The team will be adopting the \href{https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/}{PEP8} (Python Enhancement Proposal 8) 
coding standard for the project. This coding standard is commonly used in the 
Python community and ensures that the team's code remains 
consistent and readable across the entire project.\\
To support this, the team will also use the Flake8 linter tool to automate the 
checking of the adherance of the team's code to the PEP8 standard. The tool will
also assist in highlighting any style and quality issues.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}


\textbf{Moly Mikhail Reflection}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  \textbf{Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?} \newline
    I believe it is important to create a development prior to starting a project as it lets you consider ahead of time the different 
    components. It allows you to plan out the work to be done and the different technologies that will be required. Furthermore, if a technology 
    is needed such as machine learning or a python library that some team members are not familiar with, planning prior to starting the project will give
    them a chance to schedule time to learn and practice with the technology. Another reason it is important to create a development plan is that it ensures that the project begins with a strong foundation.
    For example, discussing unit testing, code coverage and git practices prior to starting the project will ensure the project remains organized and stable throughout the development process. It also sets 
    expectations between group members of the code quality expected and the pull request review process to be completed.
    
    \item \textbf{In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?} \newline
    I believe there are many advantages and disadvantages to using CI/CD. One advantage is that it ensures that the project remains stable and behaves as expected when new features are implemented. 
    For example, when a developer completes a feature, CI/CD checks that all previously functioning application features remain working as expected and no bugs are introduced. Another advantage
    is that when the application is in production and being used by customers, CI/CD will help ensure that releases only contain code that has passed all written tests.  This improves customer experiences
    as it reduces the chance of them encountering bugs or errors.  
    One disadvantage of CI/CD is that it can be very time-consuming and require many resources. For example, if a project is hosted on AWS, continuously redeploying the application
    can require many resources and increase cost. Another disadvantage of CI/CD is that when the CI/CD pipeline fails, it often requires a more 
    experienced individual or a specialist to investigate the reason for the failure.

    \item \textbf{What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,
    and how did you resolve them?}
    We didn't face any disagreements when completing this deliverable.
