\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

The software being tested is called Reading4All. This software will utilize artificial intelligence (AI)/
machine learning (ML) techniques to provide detailed, context-informed alternative text for complex technical images, specifically those found in post-secondary Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)
course materials. Reading4All will allow users to upload images and automatically produce corresponding alternative text, that meet the outlined criteria. The system is intended for use by McMaster University students and faculty, therefore it will include user validation through McMaster's sign-on, ensuring that only verified users can access the Reading4All system.  
In addition, the system will allow users to edit the generated alternative text, view a history of uploaded images and their alternative text within that session and download the final outputs in their desired formats.


\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}


\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}


The objective of this Verification and Validation (VnV) plan is to build confidence in the correctness, accessibility and usability of the Reading4All system. 
The plan focuses on ensuring that the system generates, accurate, detailed and contextually appropriate alternative text for complex STEM images, as this is the main functionality of the software. 
It also aims to verify that the systems interface is accessible an usable for individuals with visual impairments, who are one of the main users of the software. The last object is to demonstrate effective and accessible usability in secondary features
such as editing the outputted alternative text, viewing session history and file downloading. 
Verifying and validating these objectives is essential to ensure that users can benefit from the Reading4All system and 
it can effectively fulfill its goal of making STEM diagrams more accessible.
\\

Some objectives are out of scope from this VnV plan due to the time and resource limitations of the project.
The external libraries that might be used in the development of the system, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Pandas and frontend frameworks, will not be verified by our team, as they will be assumed to have been tested and validated by their implementation teams. 
The McMaster sign-on authentication service will also not be tested, as its maintained and run by the university.

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
course instructor.  You can use a pull request to update your challenge level
(in TeamComposition.csv or Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the
VnV planning exercise.}

\wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.  You can create BibTeX entries for your
  documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the documents.}

\citet{SRS}

\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.  You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Verification and Validation Responsibility Breakdown}
    \label{tab:data-dictionary-reading4all}
    \begin{tabular}{ |p{3.0cm}|p{3.8cm}|p{7.3cm}| }
      \hline
      \textbf{Name} & \textbf{ Focus Area } & \textbf{Responsibility} \\
      \hline
      Moly Mikhail and Fiza Sehar & Functional Requirements Tester & Completes manuel testing on the software to ensure that functional requirements are met. Also oversees any written unit tests to ensure they correctly test the system and intended functionality \\
      \hline
      Nawaal Fatima & User Testing Preparation & Coordinates the user testing sessions, and oversees the planning and execution of the sessions. \\
      \hline 
      Casey Francine Bulaclac & Usability Requirements Tester & Completes manuel testing to ensure all the defined usability requirements are met. Also references WCAG 2.1 crtieria is met, prior to automated testing. \\
      \hline 
      Dhruv Sardana & Look and Feel Requirements & Evaluates the systems design and interface to ensure the outlined requreiments are met. Also references WCAG 2.1 criteria is met, prior to automated testing. \\
      \hline 
      Ms. Jingchuan Sui (Supervisor) & Overall Usability and Quality of Alternative Text Reviewer & Reviews and provides feedback to team on the overall usability of the system and the quality of the generated alternative text. Also helps team complete automating evaluation of the system against WCAG 2.1 criteria. \\ 
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{table}
  
  
\subsection{SRS Verification}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may
  include ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates (like your
  primary reviewer), or you may plan for something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{If you have a supervisor for the project, you shouldn't just say they will
read over the SRS.  You should explain your structured approach to the review.
Will you have a meeting?  What will you present?  What questions will you ask?
Will you give them instructions for a task-based inspection?  Will you use your
issue tracker?}

The verification of the Reading4All SRS will be completed through supervisor feedback, user testing,
team review and a peer review. \\

\textbf{Team Review}:
As the Reading4All team has already reviewed the outlined requirements in the SRS document, an team review will 
consist of each team member individually going through each requirement and trying to validate it manually. 
Furthermore, the team review will also ensure that any previously determined numerical constraints are met and realistic.  \\


\textbf{Supervisor Feedback}
We will dedicate one of our weekly scheduled meetings with our supervisor to verifying our SRS document. 
We will first highlight functional and non functional requirements and ensure we have not missed any.
This will ensure our supervisor has a good understanding of the specific requirements we have outlined and can keep them in 
mind when completing a task based inspection. During this inspection, we will provide our supervisor with a checklist that they can review while trying to 
use all the main functionalities within the system. \\

\textbf{User Testing}
User Testing will be used to verify the non-functional requirements of the system. Participants will being given access to the system 
and asked to complete a predefined list of tasks such as uploading multiple images, viewing their session history and downloading the output. The team will
be present during these sessions to observe and note any challenges the users face. The participants will also be asked follow-up questions to gain additional feedback on their overall experience. 



\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

The Verification and Validation plan will be verified to ensure its completeness, and alignment with previous 
documents such as our SRS, HA and development plan. This will be completed through a team and peer review. \\

\textbf{Team Review}\\
The team will perform a review to ensure that the unit testing described within the document effectively tests the system and achieves the defined objectives. 
This review will involve the team collaboratively going through the document, identifying areas for improvement and making the necessary changes before completing further validation activities.\\

\textbf{Peer Review}\\
A peer review will be completed by Team 10 (One of a Kind) to provide feedback on our V\&V plan. They will review the document to ensure that the sections are consistent and aligned, as well as to identify any missing unit tests.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be
verified.  Techniques for this include review and mutation testing.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
  verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
  walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\wss{The final class presentation in CAS 741 could be used as a code
walkthrough.  There is also a possibility of using the final presentation (in
CAS741) for a partial usability survey.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Tests}

\wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
the contents of the subsections.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}
		
\paragraph{Title for Test}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Control: Manual versus Automatic
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs.  Output is not how you
are going to return the results of the test.  The output is the expected
result.}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}
		
\paragraph{Title for Test}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed:

How test will be performed: 

\item{...\\}
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
