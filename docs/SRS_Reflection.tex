\textbf{Casey Francine Bulaclac - Reflection}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? \\[1ex]
  Having discussed the project thoroughly as a team and with our supervisor helped in writing this deliverable as the team
  was very knowledgeable about the needs for the project. 
  This deliverable went much smoother than the last due to stronger operational procedures, and better organization in how we structured and completed the SRS. 
  The team communicated well and were clear of the goals for this deliverable.
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did
  you resolve them?\\[1ex]
  One pain point in writing the SRS was figuring out what each of the many sections entailed in the Volere's template. The template 
  is very thorough and needed many details, in which some sections seem to overlap which can be confusing. Another pain point was ensuring traceability
  between our goals in the project and the requirements. To resolve this, I made sure to ask the TA for feedback and clarification about specific sections.
  Additionally, communicating with each team member and ensuring our requirements aligned to the goals of the project was very helpful in aiding to ensure
  traceability.
  \item How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your
  client(s) or their proxies (e.g. your peers, stakeholders, potential users)? \\[1ex]
  Many, if not most, requirements were inspired through speaking with our supervisor, who had the most knowledge and experience with our project's 
  potential users and stakeholders. In this project, it is important to understand our target users as we are designing for accessibility, so it was critical 
  in making our requirements. 
  \item Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help
  your team to be successful with your capstone project.\\[1ex]
  In this deliverable, the course that was most beneficial was Software Requirements and Security Considerations (SFWRENG 3RA3) as we learned how to create effected SRS documents.
  A course I've taken that will help thoroughly in ensuring our user interface is accessible is Human Computer Interfaces (SFWRENG 4HC3) as the course taught us principles of good design. Lastly,
  another course I took that contribute to the success of our project is Applications of Machine Learning (SFWRENG 4AL3) as this project heavily involves machine learning
  in generating alternative text.
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member. \\[1ex]

  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
