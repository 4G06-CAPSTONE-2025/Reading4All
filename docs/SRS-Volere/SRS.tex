\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose of Document}
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the \progname{} system, \textbf{Reading4All}. The document explains the project's aims, context, restrictions, and expected behavior in order to ensure that developers, accessibility professionals, instructors, and project stakeholders all have a shared understanding.

This SRS provides a formal reference for Reading4All's design, implementation, testing, and validation. It establishes a clear link between user requirements, accessibility standards (such as AODA and WCAG 2.1), and system features that enable reliable alternative text generation for technical diagrams.

\subsection{Scope of Project}
Reading4All is an artificial intelligence/machine learning tool that provides detailed and contextually aware alternative text for complicated technical graphics, notably those found in postsecondary STEM course materials. The system combines machine vision and natural language generation models to assess diagram content, identify key parts, and provide text descriptions that are compatible with screen readers and assistive technology.

\noindent \textbf{Core objectives:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automate the creation of comprehensive and accurate alternative text for technical diagrams.
    \item Maintain compliance with the \textbf{Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)} and the \textbf{WCAG 2.1} accessibility standards.
    \item Improve the learning experiences and inclusion of students with visual challenges in higher education.
    \item Reduce the instructor effort and institutional costs related to manual alt-text creation.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Final deliverable includes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A web-based or locally hosted interface for uploading images and creating alternative-texts.
    \item A backend service that combines AI models for diagram analysis and generation of languages.

\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
There are a number of existing AI generated alternative text off-the-shelf software in the market today. The following 
highlights a few of these tools, including their functions, benefits, and limitations: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Azure AI Vision Image Analysis}: This service by Microsoft can extract a wide variety of 
  visual features from images. Image Analysis offers image captioning models that generate one-sentence descriptions of an image's visual content.
  Limitations of this product is that it only generates one simple sentence, and that the image
  captions are only available in English.
  \item \textbf{ALTTEXT.AI}: This service allows users to upload images and generate alternative text. The website supports
  over 100 languages and many modern image formats. A significant limitation of this project
  is that it doesn't guarantee compliance with WCAG which limits accessibility.
  \item \textbf{accessiBe}: This service is an accessibility platform built for developers and engineers that plugs into their SDLC to detect and 
  remediate WCAG issues at code level. The tools offers AI alt-text descriptions for images and allows users to review 
  and edit the alt text. A limitiation of this tool is that it uses overlays that sit on top of a website to fix issues at run-time. This is an issue 
  because overlays can conflict with assistive technologies and miss context-specific WCAG requirements creating a false sense of real accessibility compliance.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
The anticipated workplace environment for this product is academic settings such as universities, where students may 
require alternative text to interpret images and figures within their coursework and study materials.

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
Currently, alternative text generation tools are able to provide sufficient descriptions for simple images and figures. However, for more complex visuals 
such as engineering diagrams, the generated alt text is often misleading, incomplete, or inefficient at conveying the intended meaning.\\
Accurate alternative text is particularly essential for individuals with visual or cognitive impairments, as it enables fair access to academic content. Without 
reliable descriptions, students may experience barriers to learning and miss critical information conveyed in diagrams and figures.\\
The current limitations of existing generated alternative text tools are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Inaccurate Alternative Text}: Generated alt text may emphasize unimportant details and overlook key elements, 
  resulting in misleading or confusing interpretations.
  \item \textbf{Oversimplification of Complex Figures}: Current tools frequently oversimplify technical or academic diagrams, 
  failing to capture essential details required for learning.
  \item \textbf{High Manual Effort}: In many cases, subject matter experts must manually create alt text, 
  which is time-intensive and not scalable across large volumes of academic content.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{The Context of the Work}
The product will be in the form of a website that integrates into existing accessibility workflows
by providing accurate descriptions from images that can be read aloud by screen readers. The product 
will complement existing screen readers by ensuring accurate generated alternative text from 
uploaded images and figures of academic work are available. \href{fig:work-context}{Figure1} shows 
how the product will integrate with existing screen readers.\\

\section{Costs}

The total cost of developing this project is primarily based on the effort contributed by the student development team and faculty supervisors. As the project utilizes open-source technologies (e.g., Python, TensorFlow, Flask, and React) and university-hosted infrastructure, no direct monetary expenditure is incurred. The project is scheduled to be completed within the academic term (MVP ready by April 2026), and resource allocation is focused on efficient time management and workload balancing rather than financial cost.

\subsection{Metrics for Estimation}

To estimate overall development cost in terms of time and effort, the following key metrics have been considered:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of image input/output workflows supported by the tool.
    \item Number of core functional requirements (e.g., image upload, alt-text generation, user authentication, evaluation metrics).
    \item Number of non-functional requirements (e.g., accessibility compliance, latency, privacy, and scalability).
    \item Number of deliverables and milestones within the development timeline.
    \item Team size and individual role distribution (frontend, backend, model integration, documentation).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Estimation Approach}

Each deliverable has been estimated based on the effort required to implement, test, and document it within the given academic term.  
The estimates are derived from prior experience with similar web-based machine learning projects and adjusted for the learning and research effort required to integrate accessibility and WCAG compliance features.  
Time allocation also accounts for model fine-tuning, front-end accessibility testing, and usability evaluation with pilot users.

\subsection{Cost Breakdown}

\noindent\textbf{• Development Effort:} Based on a team of four student developers and one faculty supervisor, the estimated time allocation per team member is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial research, planning, and requirement analysis: \textbf{40 hours per team member.}
    \item Model integration and backend implementation: \textbf{120 hours per team member.}
    \item Frontend development and accessibility compliance: \textbf{80 hours per team member.}
    \item Testing, debugging, and refinement: \textbf{60 hours per team member.}
    \item Documentation and presentation preparation: \textbf{30 hours per team member.}
\end{itemize}
\noindent\textbf{Total estimated effort: 330 hours per team member.}

\noindent\textbf{• Tools and Software:}  
All software components used in the project (Python, Flask, React, TensorFlow, Machine Learning Models, and GitHub) are open-source or free for academic use.  
Therefore, there are no direct licensing or software procurement costs.

\noindent\textbf{• Testing Environment:}  
Testing will be conducted using McMaster-hosted or open-source platforms for model inference and user testing.
The team might decide to conduct user testing and award attendees 10 dollar Amazon.com gift cards as a reward for participation.  
No additional hardware purchases are required beyond existing student laptops and cloud compute credits provided for academic purposes.

\subsection{Estimated Cost}

The total development effort is estimated at approximately \textbf{1,320 person-hours} across all team members (4 × 330 hours).  
Assuming an average academic hourly equivalent of \textbf{\$20 per hour} for estimation purposes, the notional cost of development would be approximately \textbf{\$26,400 CAD}.  

However, as this project is conducted as part of a capstone academic course and leverages free university and open-source resources, the \textbf{actual monetary cost is \$0 CAD}.  
The effective cost of the project lies entirely in time, research, and human effort required to meet the performance, accessibility, and security requirements outlined in previous sections.

\section{User Documentation and Training}
\subsection{User Documentation Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item User Manual
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Purpose}: The user manual will serve as a user guide and provide detailed information and instructions on the final product and how to use it effectively
    \item \textbf{Target Audience}: Academic students, instructors, and other professionals
    \item \textbf{Content}: Website navigation and instructions, usage examples, product purposes, and best practices
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Training Requirements}
Users of the final product will require minimal to no training as we aim to ensure that the tool is as accessible, simple, and intuitive as possible. For any additional guidance,
a user manual will be created along with any relevant tutorials on how to use the features within the website. 

\section{Waiting Room}
This section lists potential ideas and features that are out of scope for the current project, however, may be valuable for future updates. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Support for multilingual alternative text generation (e.g., French and Spanish)
  \item A browser extension that automatically generates alternative text on websites or learning platforms (e.g. \textit{D2L}) using our model
  \item Compatibility with mobile platforms to extend accessibility across users' preferred devices
\end{itemize}

\section{Ideas for Solution}
This section discusses potential ways to acheive some of the functionality discussed throughout this report, 
including image upload and processing, alternative text generation and session history. 
These ideas have been documented so they can be referenced later during development.\\
\\
\textbf{Image Upload and Processing}
This functionality can be achieved through a front-end interface, where users are prompted to upload an image using an upload button or by dragging their file into the drop box. Furthermore, to minimize errors, this will only allow JPEG and PNG image files. 
Once the image has been uploaded, it will be displayed to the user with the image file name, so users can confirm the correct file was chosen. 
If the upload fails, the system will display an error message explaining the issue. Furthermore, this can be achieved using the HTML5 File API, which supports reading and processing file data, specifically obtained through input or drag and drop. \\
\\
\textbf{Alternative Text Generation}
This functionality can be implemented using a vision-language model (VLM), which combines natural language models with computer vision. 
The model can learn from both images and text to solve various problems. The model can be trained using sample scientific images, paired with examples of descriptive alternative text, allow it to generate accurate and high quality descriptions for new images.\\
\\
\textbf{Session History}
After the user is satisfied with the generated alternative text, the system will store the image and its final description in the browser's session storage as a JSON record. This allows the data to be stored temporarily and can easily be displayed to the user when they request their history. \\
