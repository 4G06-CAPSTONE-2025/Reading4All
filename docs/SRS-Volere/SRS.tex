\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
\lips
\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\lips
\section{Stakeholders}
The project stakeholders consist of people who have a need or
interest, whether direct or indirect, for alternative text generation
for visual, idle
content (such as images or diagrams). These stakeholders will
influence and be affected by the
project's development decisions and progress. To meet user
needs, it is vital to understand the stakeholder roles and expectations.
\par First, this section introduces the client, customer and other
stakeholders involved in this project. Then, the product users are
described, specifically the hands-on users of the project. Finally,
personas, priority levels and anticipated
participation levels are listed for each stakeholder.
\subsection{Client}
This project's client is Ms. Jingchuan Sui who works as a Media Lab
Specialist Supervisor at the Faculty of Engineering, McMaster
University. As this project's supervisor, her main role is to provide
guidance and voice any concerns during the development phase with her
technical and domain expertise. She will be the main source for
setting requirements while also being directly involved in the
development of this project, providing feedback and opinions on the
Human-Computer interface components.
\subsection{Customer}
The customers of this product are McMaster users, specifically,
McMaster students, staff and teaching instructors who are directly
involved in learning from course content or making them accessible as per the
Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA). In other
words, McMaster University stakeholders who benefit directly from
accessible course content. For
example, primary customers can include students who use a screen reader for
learning purposes or
a teaching assistant who is making a course's content AODA compliant.
Furthermore, under her
position at McMaster University, Ms. Sui can also be considered a
customer, as she aids in course content remediation and thus, is also
one of the intended end-users.
\par For development, Group 22 is tailoring the solution to the
McMaster demographic in line with Ms. Sui’s requirements. However,
the product has the potential to support any users who require
alternative text generation for visual content. Feedback from
McMaster stakeholders will be prioritized to maintain a clear and
manageable scope.
\subsection{Other Stakeholders}
This subsection discusses other groups that are indirectly impacted
or who contribute to the ecosystem of accessibility, content
creation, and AODA compliance.
\subsubsection {Faculty of Engineering Instructors}
This group consists of professors and lecturers responsible for
creating and maintaining
course content. They may benefit from automated alternative text generation
to ensure their teaching materials are accessible.
\subsubsection {Teaching Assistants (TAs)}
As part of their work, TAs are often responsible for preparing,
modifying, and uploading course
content. They are stakeholders as they could use the system to
simplify accessibility compliance.
\subsubsection {Accessibility Services Office at McMaster}
This group includes staff members who oversee accessibility
compliance and provide
accommodations for students. They have a strong interest in ensuring
tools meet AODA standards.
\subsubsection {McMaster IT Services / Media Production Services}
These teams may be involved in system integration, technical support,
and maintenance of the product within the university’s digital infrastructure.
\subsubsection {Students with Accessibility Needs}
These students are those who may not be primary testers but are
indirectly impacted
by improved accessibility of course materials.
\subsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}
\subsubsection{Students with Accessibility Needs}
In some cases, students who use screen readers may provide feedback
loops to improve generated alternative text. While they are customers, they
may also be “hands-on” users if they test or adjust alt text themselves.
\subsubsection{Teaching Staff}
This group consists of TAs and instructors. As mentioned above, TAs
Frequently upload, adapt, and remediate course content. They would be
interacting directly with the tool to generate and refine alt text.
On the other hand, some instructors (especially those who prepare
their own slides, diagrams, or assignments) would use the system to
add or edit alternative text.
\subsection{Personas}
\subsubsection*{Persona: Alice Bayes}
\textbf{Age:} 27 \\
\textbf{Job Title:} Teaching Assistant at McMaster University\\
\textbf{Education:} Bachelor's in History\\
\textbf{Work Environment:} Alice works under several teaching
instructors to help deliver course content to students. She is in
charge of marking assignments and has recently been tasked with
auditing then remediating any inaccessible learning content. \\
\textbf{Professional Background:} Alice graduated two years ago, and
as part of her undergraduate career, she has experience in working
with students with disabilities. She is trained on making content
accessible and AODA compliant.\\[2mm]
\textbf{Need:} With so many courses to grade student work for, Alice
needs a tool that can easily and quickly generate content for her to
use as alternative text while she can ensure that her boss' teaching
content meets AODA compliance.\\
\textbf{Challenges:} Balancing her work and life has been difficult
as there are multiple images per document, and several documents per
course. She is overwhelmed with the amount of grading she has to do
on top of manually writing alternative text for over 50 images.

\subsubsection*{Persona: Chetan Dakshesh}
\textbf{Age:} 20 \\
\textbf{Job Title:} Chetan is a student at McMaster University.\\
\textbf{Education:} He is currently pursuing a Bachelor's in
Electrical Engineering\\
\textbf{Work Environment:} Chetan has a super busy course load with
six courses and volleyball club!\\
\textbf{Professional Background:} \\[2mm]
\textbf{Need:} With so many courses and volleyball practice to keep
up with, Chetan is finding it hard to keep track of course content.
Furthermore, through his screen reader, he has picked up that there
is no alternative text generated for several diagrams in a course he
is taking. These diagrams are vital to his learning experience but he
has little clue on what they indicate. \\
\textbf{Challenges:} Using large language models (LLMs) such as
Chat-GPT doesn't work for him as the text generated is too generic
and lacks substance. Chetan needs a tool that can effectively
describe the diagram to him while staying relevant to the course material.

\subsubsection*{Persona: Eyad Fahim}
\textbf{Age:} 40 \\
\textbf{Job Title:} Professor at McMaster University\\
\textbf{Education:} Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Engineering\\
\textbf{Work Environment:} Eyad works on a fast paced work
environment, connecting with over 100 students.
\textbf{Professional Background:} With over 20 years of experience both in
the workforce and academic, Eyad loves to teach the next generation
of leaders about various engineering techniques.\\[2mm]
\textbf{Need:} With the goal to
celebrate students of experiences, Eyad is looking for help to make
his teaching content accessible for all.\\
\textbf{Challenges:} Eyad needs a fast tool that can help gap the
accessibility knowledge he lacks. He wants to ensure all students can
learn from his materials with little to no barriers, including
alternative text but he has no idea how to get started.
\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}
\textbf{Primary users:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Students with accessibility needs
  \item Ms. Jingchuan Sui

usability testing to ensure AODA compliance and to further refine the product.
\subsection{Maintenance Users and Service Technicians}
For this project, maintenance activities may involve updating
alternative text generation models, fixing bugs, or upgrading dependencies.
\subsubsection*{Expected Maintenance Users and Roles}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{McMaster IT Services / Media Production Services} \\
    These teams may oversee deployment, integration with
    institutional systems, and technical support. They require access
    to configuration tools, diagnostic information, and documentation
    for updates or troubleshooting.
  \item \textbf{Accessibility Services Office Staff} \\
    Although initially secondary stakeholders, some staff may
    contribute to iterative refinement of alt-text generation
    accuracy or compliance updates. Their participation may prompt
    system adjustments or patches.
  \item \textbf{Development Team (Group 22) or Future Maintainership Team} \\
    During initial deployment and handover, the development team or a
    designated successor group may perform updates to improve
    usability, resolve technical issues, or adapt to new
    accessibility standards.
