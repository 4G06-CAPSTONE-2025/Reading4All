    {\bf Rationale:} This ensures that the solution ensures inclusivity for users with visual, auditory, or cognitive impairments\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The solution must past all tests using WCAG automated testing tools and manual tests.\\
    {\bf Priority:} High
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}[label=MD-SL \arabic*., wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
  \item \emph{The solution must be implemented as a website}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} A website will allow for automated testing against the WCAG standards which ensures accesibility for users 
    and allow users to upload images/figures to generate alternative text\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The website must be functional and allow users to generate alternative text by uploading
    images and figures\\
    {\bf Priority:} High
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}[label=MD-SL \arabic*., wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
  \item \emph{The solution must support common image formats (e.g. JPEG, PNG, etc.)}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} The website will enable users to upload images or figures to generate the alternative text, therefore the solution must be able 
    to handle the different types of image formats\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The product must successfully process at least one image of each required format including JPEG and PNG
    images and figures\\
    {\bf Priority:} High
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
\begin{enumerate}[label=MD-IE \arabic*., wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
  \item \emph{The product must be able to run on standard laptop environments, including operatins systems (OS) such as 
  macOS, Windows, and Linux}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} This ensures that the product is compatible with major operating systems to allow the product to be 
    accessible to users, regardless of their laptop environment\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The product must successfully install and operate on the latest releases of macOS, Windows, and Linux,
    verified through installation and functionality testing on each OS\\
    {\bf Priority:} High
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
\begin{enumerate}[label=MD-PA \arabic*., wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
  \item \emph{The product must not conflict with other accessibility tools (e.g. screen readers, screen magnifiers, dictation software)}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} This is to ensure that the product does not limit or intefere with other accessibility tools that 
    meets the users' needs \\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The product must operate simultaneously with at least one other accessibility tool,
    verified through interoperability testing \\
    {\bf Priority:} High
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
There are a number of existing AI generated alternative text off-the-shelf software in the market today. The following 
highlights a few of these tools, including their functions, benefits, and limitations: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Azure AI Vision Image Analysis}: This service by Microsoft can extract a wide variety of 
  visual features from images. Image Analysis offers image captioning models that generate one-sentence descriptions of an image's visual content.
  Limitations of this product is that it only generates one simple sentence, and that the image
  captions are only available in English.
  \item \textbf{ALTTEXT.AI}: This service allows users to upload images and generate alternative text. The website supports
  over 100 languages and many modern image formats. A significant limitation of this project
  is that it doesn't guarantee compliance with WCAG which limits accessibility.
  \item \textbf{accessiBe}: This service is an accessibility platform built for developers and engineers that plugs into their SDLC to detect and 
  remediate WCAG issues at code level. The tools offers AI alt-text descriptions for images and allows users to review 
  and edit the alt text. A limitiation of this tool is that it uses overlays that sit on top of a website to fix issues at run-time. This is an issue 
  because overlays can conflict with assistive technologies and miss context-specific WCAG requirements creating a false sense of real accessibility compliance.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
The anticipated workplace environment for this product is academic settings such as universities, where students may 
require alternative text to interpret images and figures within their coursework and study materials. 
\subsection{Schedule Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}[label=MD-SC \arabic*., wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
  \item \emph{The final product must be completed and tested by the end of the academic term (April 2026)}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} This is to ensure that the final product is functional and meets all requirements
    at the end of the academic year\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} All deliverables are submitted, and the final product is tested and operable by April 2026 \\
    {\bf Priority:} High
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Budget Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}[label=MD-BC \arabic*., wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
  \item \emph{The project budget must include compensation for user testers, set at maximum \$150 per participant for two rounds of usability testing.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} This is to ensure that user testers are compensated for their meaningful feedback, 
    and that our testing aligns with ethical practices\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} There must be record of participants being compensated between the range of \$100 and \$150 for
    two rounds of testing. \\
    {\bf Priority:} High
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Enterprise Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}[label=MD-EC \arabic*., wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
  \item \emph{The product must comply with the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} This ensures that the product meets the legal requirements in Ontario and guarantees that 
    the product is accessible to users with diverse needs\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} AODA requires compliance with WCAG standards, which ensures that the product meets AODA regulations.

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
Currently, alternative text generation tools are able to provide sufficient descriptions for simple images and figures. However, for more complex visuals 
such as engineering diagrams, the generated alt text is often misleading, incomplete, or inefficient at conveying the intended meaning.\\
Accurate alternative text is particularly essential for individuals with visual or cognitive impairments, as it enables fair access to academic content. Without 
reliable descriptions, students may experience barriers to learning and miss critical information conveyed in diagrams and figures.\\
The current limitations of existing generated alternative text tools are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Inaccurate Alternative Text}: Generated alt text may emphasize unimportant details and overlook key elements, 
  resulting in misleading or confusing interpretations.
  \item \textbf{Oversimplification of Complex Figures}: Current tools frequently oversimplify technical or academic diagrams, 
  failing to capture essential details required for learning.
  \item \textbf{High Manual Effort}: In many cases, subject matter experts must manually create alt text, 
  which is time-intensive and not scalable across large volumes of academic content.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{The Context of the Work}
The product will be in the form of a website that integrates into existing accessibility workflows
by providing accurate descriptions from images that can be read aloud by screen readers. The product 
will complement existing screen readers by ensuring accurate generated alternative text from 
uploaded images and figures of academic work are available. \href{fig:work-context}{Figure1} shows 
how the product will integrate with existing screen readers.\\
