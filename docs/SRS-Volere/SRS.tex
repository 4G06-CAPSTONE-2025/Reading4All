\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose of Document}
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the functional
and non-functional requirements for the \progname{} system,
\textbf{Reading4All}. The document explains the project's aims,
context, restrictions, and expected behavior in order to ensure that
developers, accessibility professionals, instructors, and project
stakeholders all have a shared understanding.

This SRS provides a formal reference for Reading4All's design,
implementation, testing, and validation. It establishes a clear link
between user requirements, accessibility standards (such as AODA and
WCAG 2.1), and system features that enable reliable alternative text
generation for technical diagrams.

\subsection{Scope of Project}
Reading4All is an artificial intelligence/machine learning tool that
provides detailed and contextually aware alternative text for
complicated technical graphics, notably those found in postsecondary
STEM course materials. The system combines machine vision and natural
language generation models to assess diagram content, identify key
parts, and provide text descriptions that are compatible with screen
readers and assistive technology.

\noindent \textbf{Core objectives:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Automate the creation of comprehensive and accurate
    alternative text for technical diagrams.
  \item Maintain compliance with the \textbf{Accessibility for
    Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)} and the \textbf{WCAG 2.1}
    accessibility standards.
  \item Improve the learning experiences and inclusion of students
    with visual challenges in higher education.
  \item Reduce the instructor effort and institutional costs related
    to manual alt-text creation.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Final deliverable includes:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A web-based or locally hosted interface for uploading images
    and creating alternative-texts.
  \item A backend service that combines AI models for diagram
    analysis and generation of languages.
  \item Structured output formats are suitable with systems for
    learning management and screen readers.
\end{itemize}

\section{Stakeholders}
The project stakeholders consist of people who have a need or
interest, whether direct or indirect, for alternative text generation
for visual, idle
content (such as images or diagrams). These stakeholders will
influence and be affected by the
project's development decisions and progress. To meet user
needs, it is vital to understand the stakeholder roles and expectations.
\par First, this section introduces the client, customer and other
stakeholders involved in this project. Then, the product users are
described, specifically the hands-on users of the project. Finally,
personas, priority levels and anticipated
participation levels are listed for each stakeholder.
\subsection{Client}
This project's client is Ms. Jingchuan Sui who works as a Media Lab
Specialist Supervisor at the Faculty of Engineering, McMaster
University. As this project's supervisor, her main role is to provide
guidance and voice any concerns during the development phase with her
technical and domain expertise. She will be the main source for
setting requirements while also being directly involved in the
development of this project, providing feedback and opinions on the
Human-Computer interface components.
\subsection{Customer}
The customers of this product are McMaster users, specifically,
McMaster students, staff and teaching instructors who are directly
involved in learning from course content or making them accessible as per the
Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA). In other
words, McMaster University stakeholders who benefit directly from
accessible course content. For
example, primary customers can include students who use a screen reader for
learning purposes or
a teaching assistant who is making a course's content AODA compliant.
Furthermore, under her
position at McMaster University, Ms. Sui can also be considered a
customer, as she aids in course content remediation and thus, is also
one of the intended end-users.
\par For development, Group 22 is tailoring the solution to the
McMaster demographic in line with Ms. Sui’s requirements. However,
the product has the potential to support any users who require
alternative text generation for visual content. Feedback from
McMaster stakeholders will be prioritized to maintain a clear and
manageable scope.
\subsection{Other Stakeholders}
This subsection discusses other groups that are indirectly impacted
or who contribute to the ecosystem of accessibility, content
creation, and AODA compliance.
\subsubsection {Faculty of Engineering Instructors}
This group consists of professors and lecturers responsible for
creating and maintaining
course content. They may benefit from automated alternative text generation
to ensure their teaching materials are accessible.
\subsubsection {Teaching Assistants (TAs)}
As part of their work, TAs are often responsible for preparing,
modifying, and uploading course
content. They are stakeholders as they could use the system to
simplify accessibility compliance.
\subsubsection {Accessibility Services Office at McMaster}
This group includes staff members who oversee accessibility
compliance and provide
accommodations for students. They have a strong interest in ensuring
tools meet AODA standards.
\subsubsection {McMaster IT Services / Media Production Services}
These teams may be involved in system integration, technical support,
and maintenance of the product within the university’s digital infrastructure.
\subsubsection {Students with Accessibility Needs}
These students are those who may not be primary testers but are
indirectly impacted
by improved accessibility of course materials.
\subsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}
\subsubsection{Students with Accessibility Needs}
In some cases, students who use screen readers may provide feedback
loops to improve generated alternative text. While they are customers, they
may also be “hands-on” users if they test or adjust alt text themselves.
\subsubsection{Teaching Staff}
This group consists of TAs and instructors. As mentioned above, TAs
Frequently upload, adapt, and remediate course content. They would be
interacting directly with the tool to generate and refine alt text.
On the other hand, some instructors (especially those who prepare
their own slides, diagrams, or assignments) would use the system to
add or edit alternative text.
\subsection{Personas}
\subsubsection*{Persona: Alice Bayes}
\textbf{Age:} 27 \\
\textbf{Job Title:} Teaching Assistant at McMaster University\\
\textbf{Education:} Bachelor's in History\\
\textbf{Work Environment:} Alice works under several teaching
instructors to help deliver course content to students. She is in
charge of marking assignments and has recently been tasked with
auditing then remediating any inaccessible learning content. \\
\textbf{Professional Background:} Alice graduated two years ago, and
as part of her undergraduate career, she has experience in working
with students with disabilities. She is trained on making content
accessible and AODA compliant.\\[2mm]
\textbf{Need:} With so many courses to grade student work for, Alice
needs a tool that can easily and quickly generate content for her to
use as alternative text while she can ensure that her boss' teaching
content meets AODA compliance.\\
\textbf{Challenges:} Balancing her work and life has been difficult
as there are multiple images per document, and several documents per
course. She is overwhelmed with the amount of grading she has to do
on top of manually writing alternative text for over 50 images.

\subsubsection*{Persona: Chetan Dakshesh}
\textbf{Age:} 20 \\
\textbf{Job Title:} Chetan is a student at McMaster University.\\
\textbf{Education:} He is currently pursuing a Bachelor's in
Electrical Engineering\\

six courses and volleyball club!\\
\textbf{Professional Background:} \\[2mm]
\textbf{Need:} With so many courses and volleyball practice to keep
up with, Chetan is finding it hard to keep track of course content.
Furthermore, through his screen reader, he has picked up that there
is no alternative text generated for several diagrams in a course he
is taking. These diagrams are vital to his learning experience but he
has little clue on what they indicate. \\
\textbf{Challenges:} Using large language models (LLMs) such as
Chat-GPT doesn't work for him as the text generated is too generic
and lacks substance. Chetan needs a tool that can effectively
describe the diagram to him while staying relevant to the course material.

\subsubsection*{Persona: Eyad Fahim}
\textbf{Age:} 40 \\
\textbf{Job Title:} Professor at McMaster University\\
\textbf{Education:} Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Engineering\\

the workforce and academic, Eyad loves to teach the next generation
of leaders about various engineering techniques.\\[2mm]
\textbf{Need:} With the goal to
celebrate students of experiences, Eyad is looking for help to make
his teaching content accessible for all.\\
\textbf{Challenges:} Eyad needs a fast tool that can help gap the
accessibility knowledge he lacks. He wants to ensure all students can
learn from his materials with little to no barriers, including
alternative text but he has no idea how to get started.

    AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 standards}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} This ensures that the solution demonstrates
    inclusivity for users with visual, auditory, or cognitive impairments. \\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The solution must past all tests using WCAG
    automated testing tools and manual tests.\\
    {\bf Priority:} High.
  \item \emph{The solution must be implemented as a web tool}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} A web tool will allow for automated testing
    against the WCAG standards which ensures accesibility for users
    and allow users to upload images/figures to generate alternative text.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The web tool must be functional and allow
    users to generate alternative text by uploading
    images and figures.\\
    {\bf Priority:} High.
  \item \emph{The solution must support common image formats (e.g.
        Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG), Portable Network Graphic
    (PNG), etc.)}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} The web tool will enable users to upload images
    or figures to generate the alternative text, therefore the
    solution must be able
    to handle the different types of image formats.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The product must successfully process at
    least one image of each required format including JPEG and PNG
    images and figures.\\
    {\bf Priority:} High.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
\begin{enumerate}[label=MD-IE \arabic*., wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]

    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The product must operate simultaneously with
    at least one other accessibility tool,
    verified through interoperability testing. \\
    {\bf Priority:} High.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
There are a number of existing AI generated alternative text
off-the-shelf software in the market today. The following
highlights a few of these tools, including their functions, benefits,
and limitations:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Azure AI Vision Image Analysis}: This service by
    Microsoft can extract a wide variety of
    visual features from images. Image Analysis offers image
    captioning models that generate one-sentence descriptions of an
    image's visual content.
    Limitations of this product is that it only generates one simple
    sentence, and that the image
    captions are only available in English.
  \item \textbf{ALTTEXT.AI}: This service allows users to upload
    images and generate alternative text. The website supports
    over 100 languages and many modern image formats. A significant
    limitation of this project
    is that it doesn't guarantee compliance with WCAG which limits
    accessibility.
  \item \textbf{accessiBe}: This service is an accessibility platform
    built for developers and engineers that plugs into their SDLC to detect and
    remediate WCAG issues at code level. The tools offers AI alt-text
    descriptions for images and allows users to review
    and edit the alt text. A limitiation of this tool is that it uses
    overlays that sit on top of a website to fix issues at run-time.
    This is an issue
    because overlays can conflict with assistive technologies and
    miss context-specific WCAG requirements creating a false sense of
    real accessibility compliance.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
The anticipated workplace environment for this product is academic
settings such as universities, where students may
require alternative text to interpret images and figures within their
coursework and study materials.
\subsection{Schedule Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}[label=MD-SC \arabic*., wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
  \item \emph{The final product must be completed and tested by the
    end of the academic term (April 2026)}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} This is to ensure that the final product is
    functional and meets all requirements
    at the end of the academic year.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} All deliverables are submitted, and the
    final product is tested and operable by April 2026. \\
    {\bf Priority:} High.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Budget Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}[label=MD-BC \arabic*., wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
  \item \emph{The project budget must include compensation for user
      testers, set at maximum \$150 CAD per participant for two rounds
    of usability testing.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} This is to ensure that user testers are
    compensated for their meaningful feedback,
    and that our testing aligns with ethical practices.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} There must be record of participants being
    compensated between the range of \$100 and \$150 for
    two rounds of testing. \\
    {\bf Priority:} High.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Enterprise Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}[label=MD-EC \arabic*., wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
  \item \emph{The product must comply with the Accessibility for
    Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} This ensures that the product meets the legal
    requirements in Ontario and guarantees that
    the product is accessible to users with diverse needs.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} AODA requires compliance with WCAG
    standards, which ensures that the product meets AODA regulations.
    Compliance must be verified through both automated WCAG testing
    tools and manual accessibility testing.\\
    {\bf Priority:} High.
\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}
\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
Currently, alternative text generation tools are able to provide
sufficient descriptions for simple images and figures. However, for
more complex visuals
such as engineering diagrams, the generated alt text is often
misleading, incomplete, or inefficient at conveying the intended meaning.\\
Accurate alternative text is particularly essential for individuals
with visual or cognitive impairments, as it enables fair access to
academic content. Without
reliable descriptions, students may experience barriers to learning
and miss critical information conveyed in diagrams and figures.\\
The current limitations of existing generated alternative text tools
are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Inaccurate Alternative Text}: Generated alt text may
    emphasize unimportant details and overlook key elements,
    resulting in misleading or confusing interpretations.
  \item \textbf{Oversimplification of Complex Figures}: Current tools
    frequently oversimplify technical or academic diagrams,
    failing to capture essential details required for learning.
  \item \textbf{High Manual Effort}: In many cases, subject matter
    experts must manually create alt text,
    which is time-intensive and not scalable across large volumes of
    academic content.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Context of the Work}
The product will be in the form of a web tool that integrates into
existing accessibility workflows
by providing accurate descriptions from images that can be read aloud
by screen readers. The product
will complement existing screen readers by ensuring accurate
generated alternative text from
uploaded images and figures of academic work are available.
\autoref{fig:work-context} shows
how the product will integrate with existing screen readers.

\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}
This section does not apply to this project as there is no current
system to replace, thus, no data at all.

\section{Costs}

The total cost of developing this project is primarily based on the
effort contributed by the student development team and faculty
supervisors. As the project utilizes open-source technologies (e.g.,
Python, TensorFlow, Flask, and React) and university-hosted
infrastructure, no direct monetary expenditure is incurred. The
project is scheduled to be completed within the academic term (MVP
ready by April 2026), and resource allocation is focused on efficient
time management and workload balancing rather than financial cost.

\subsection{Metrics for Estimation}

To estimate overall development cost in terms of time and effort, the
following key metrics have been considered:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Number of image input/output workflows supported by the tool.
  \item Number of core functional requirements (e.g., image upload,
    alt-text generation, user authentication, evaluation metrics).
  \item Number of non-functional requirements (e.g., accessibility
    compliance, latency, privacy, and scalability).
  \item Number of deliverables and milestones within the development timeline.
  \item Team size and individual role distribution (frontend,
    backend, model integration, documentation).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Estimation Approach}

Each deliverable has been estimated based on the effort required to
implement, test, and document it within the given academic term.
The estimates are derived from prior experience with similar
web-based machine learning projects and adjusted for the learning and
research effort required to integrate accessibility and WCAG
compliance features.
Time allocation also accounts for model fine-tuning, front-end
accessibility testing, and usability evaluation with pilot users.

\subsection{Cost Breakdown}

\noindent\textbf{• Development Effort:} Based on a team of four
student developers and one faculty supervisor, the estimated time
allocation per team member is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Initial research, planning, and requirement analysis:
    \textbf{40 hours per team member.}
  \item Model integration and backend implementation: \textbf{120
    hours per team member.}
  \item Frontend development and accessibility compliance: \textbf{80
    hours per team member.}
  \item Testing, debugging, and refinement: \textbf{60 hours per team member.}
  \item Documentation and presentation preparation: \textbf{30 hours
    per team member.}
\end{itemize}
\noindent\textbf{Total estimated effort: 330 hours per team member.}

\noindent\textbf{• Tools and Software:}
All software components used in the project (Python, Flask, React,
TensorFlow, Machine Learning Models, and GitHub) are open-source or
free for academic use.
Therefore, there are no direct licensing or software procurement costs.

\noindent\textbf{• Testing Environment:}
Testing will be conducted using McMaster-hosted or open-source
platforms for model inference and user testing.
The team might decide to conduct user testing and award attendees 10
dollar Amazon.com gift cards as a reward for participation.
No additional hardware purchases are required beyond existing student
laptops and cloud compute credits provided for academic purposes.

\subsection{Estimated Cost}

The total development effort is estimated at approximately
\textbf{1,320 person-hours} across all team members (4 × 330 hours).
Assuming an average academic hourly equivalent of \textbf{\$20 per
hour} for estimation purposes, the notional cost of development would
be approximately \textbf{\$26,400 CAD}.

However, as this project is conducted as part of a capstone academic
course and leverages free university and open-source resources, the
\textbf{actual monetary cost is \$0 CAD}.
The effective cost of the project lies entirely in time, research,
and human effort required to meet the performance, accessibility, and
security requirements outlined in previous sections.

\section{User Documentation and Training}
\subsection{User Documentation Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item User Manual
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Purpose}: The user manual will serve as a user
        guide and provide detailed information and instructions on
        the final product and how to use it effectively
      \item \textbf{Target Audience}: Academic students, instructors,
        and other professionals
      \item \textbf{Content}: Web tool navigation and instructions,
        usage examples, product purposes, and best practices
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Training Requirements}
Users of the final product will require minimal to no training as we
aim to ensure that the tool is as accessible, simple, and intuitive
as possible. For any additional guidance,
a user manual will be created along with any relevant tutorials on
how to use the features within the web tool.

\section{Waiting Room}
This section lists potential ideas and features that are out of scope
for the current project, however, may be valuable for future updates.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Support for multilingual alternative text generation (e.g.,
    French and Spanish)
  \item A browser extension that automatically generates alternative
    text on websites or learning platforms (e.g. \textit{D2L}) using our model
  \item Compatibility with mobile platforms to extend accessibility
    across users' preferred devices
\end{itemize}

\section{Ideas for Solution}
This section discusses potential ways to achieve some of the functionality discussed throughout this report, 
including image upload and processing, alternative text generation and session history. 
These ideas have been documented so they can be referenced later during development.\\
This section discusses potential ways to acheive some of the
functionality discussed throughout this report,
including image upload and processing, alternative text generation
and session history.
These ideas have been documented so they can be referenced later
during development.\\
\\
\textbf{Image Upload and Processing}
This functionality can be achieved through a front-end interface,
where users are prompted to upload an image using an upload button or
by dragging their file into the drop box. Furthermore, to minimize
errors, this will only allow JPEG and PNG image files.
Once the image has been uploaded, it will be displayed to the user
with the image file name, so users can confirm the correct file was chosen.
If the upload fails, the system will display an error message
explaining the issue. Furthermore, this can be achieved using the
HTML5 File API, which supports reading and processing file data,
specifically obtained through input or drag and drop. \\
\\
\textbf{Alternative Text Generation}
This functionality can be implemented using a vision-language model
(VLM), which combines natural language models with computer vision.
The model can learn from both images and text to solve various
problems. The model can be trained using sample scientific images,
paired with examples of descriptive alternative text, allow it to
generate accurate and high quality descriptions for new images.\\
\\
\textbf{Session History}
After the user is satisfied with the generated alternative text, the
system will store the image and its final description in the
browser's session storage as a JSON record. This allows the data to
be stored temporarily and can easily be displayed to the user when
they request their history. \\
\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\textbf{Nawaal Fatima - Reflection}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{What went well while writing this deliverable?} \newline
    Our group divided the work efficiently, which made the writing
    process smoother. I found that once we agreed on the structure,
    it became easier to contribute my part because everyone had a
    clear understanding of what they were responsible for.
    We all came together towards the end and reviewed everyone's
    parts, ensuring coherency and consistency in our writing.
    Communication also went well, and we were able to clarify
    uncertainties quickly through discussions. Personally, I felt
    more confident writing my section because I understood how my
    contribution fit into the overall deliverable.

  \item \textbf{What pain points did you experience during this
    deliverable, and how did you resolve them?} \newline
    One challenge I experienced was making sure my writing aligned
    with the tone and level of detail the rest of the team was using.
    At first, it was hard to tell how formal or detailed certain
    sections should be. I resolved this by checking in with my teammates'
    writing and reading over their parts so that my section matched in style.
    Another minor pain point was managing time alongside other
    coursework, but planning out smaller chunks helped me stay on track.
    Furthermore, my computer glitched during an update and I had to
    rewrite all of my sections which was super frustrating and
    delayed some teammate's sections. In the future I will ensure to
    commit all drafts to a remote branch before updating my computer.

  \item \textbf{How many of your requirements were inspired by
      speaking to your client(s) or their proxies (e.g., your peers,
    stakeholders, potential users)?} \newline
    A noticeable portion of the requirements came from talking to
    Ms. Sui and from my experiences working with her over the past
    three years. Even though we don't always interact with the customers
    directly, speaking to Ms. Sui and imagining how potential users
    would interact with the system helped shape several of the
    requirements. I'd estimate that roughly half of the requirements
    were influenced by those conversations or by feedback from people
    who could represent the end users.

  \item \textbf{Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently
      taking, will help your team be successful with your capstone
    project?} \newline
    Several courses connect directly to this project. Software
    engineering and requirements-focused courses helped with
    understanding how to draft clear specifications and think about
    users' needs. Any design or project-based courses gave me
    experience working in teams and coordinating deliverables.
    Courses that covered testing, human-computer interfaces,
    documentation, and development
    processes also helped ensure we follow good practices
    throughout the capstone.
