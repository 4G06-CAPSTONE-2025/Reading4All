\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose of Document}
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the \progname{} system, \textbf{Reading4All}. The document explains the project's aims, context, restrictions, and expected behavior in order to ensure that developers, accessibility professionals, instructors, and project stakeholders all have a shared understanding.

This SRS provides a formal reference for Reading4All's design, implementation, testing, and validation. It establishes a clear link between user requirements, accessibility standards (such as AODA and WCAG 2.1), and system features that enable reliable alternative text generation for technical diagrams.

\subsection{Scope of Project}
Reading4All is an artificial intelligence/machine learning tool that provides detailed and contextually aware alternative text for complicated technical graphics, notably those found in postsecondary STEM course materials. The system combines machine vision and natural language generation models to assess diagram content, identify key parts, and provide text descriptions that are compatible with screen readers and assistive technology.

\noindent \textbf{Core objectives:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automate the creation of comprehensive and accurate alternative text for technical diagrams.
    \item Maintain compliance with the \textbf{Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)} and the \textbf{WCAG 2.1} accessibility standards.
    \item Improve the learning experiences and inclusion of students with visual challenges in higher education.
    \item Reduce the instructor effort and institutional costs related to manual alt-text creation.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Final deliverable includes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A web-based or locally hosted interface for uploading images and creating alternative-texts.
    \item A backend service that combines AI models for diagram analysis and generation of languages.
    \item Structured output formats are suitable with systems for learning management and screen readers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader}
This document is intended for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Developers} who are responsible for implementing and testing the system.
    \item \textbf{Accessibility Professionals} to ensure AODA and WCAG compliance.
    \item \textbf{Academic Stakeholders} including educators, instructional designers, and content creators.
    \item \textbf{Supervisors and Assessors} who assess project completion and design quality.
\end{itemize}

Readers should have an overall knowledge of software engineering, web development, and fundamental machine learning techniques. Accessibility reviewers should understand digital accessibility principles and standards.

\subsection{Organization of Document}
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is divided into twenty-six sections following the IEEE standard structure. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sections 1–5:} Establish the foundation of the document, including the project scope, stakeholders, assumptions, and terminology.
    \item \textbf{Sections 6–10:} Define the overall system context, business model, product scope, and high-level functional requirements.
    \item \textbf{Sections 11–17:} Specify detailed non-functional requirements such as usability, performance, maintainability, security, and compliance.
    \item \textbf{Sections 18–26:} Present supporting material including open issues, off-the-shelf components, project tasks, migration plans, documentation, and solution ideas.
\end{itemize}
This organization ensures logical flow from project background to detailed requirements and supporting documentation.
