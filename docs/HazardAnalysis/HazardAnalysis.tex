\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.} 

\subsection{System Overview}
The system is a web-based AI tool that generates alternative text (alt text) for uploaded images or figures
and integrated with screen readers to improve accessibility for visually impaired users.
\subsection{System Boundaries}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Internal Components:} Alternative Text Generation Machine Learning (ML) Model, User Interface, Session History Manager
    \item \textbf{External Components:} McMaster Authentication System, External AI/ML Frameworks, Screen Reader Software
\end{itemize}
\subsection{System Components}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Alt Text Generation ML Model}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Purpose:} To automatically generate accurate and descriptive alternative text for uploaded images using machine learning.
        \item \textbf{Key Functions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Process image inputs received from the backend and extract key visual features.
            \item Generate contextually relevant text descriptions.
            \item Return the generated alternative text to the backend to display to the user interface.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Interface}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Purpose:} To serve as the primary interaction point between the user and the system and allow users to upload images and view generated alt text.
        \item \textbf{Key Functions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Enable users to upload images through an accessible web interface.
            \item Display generated alt text and allow users to edit, copy, and download the text. 
            \item Provide features that are accessible and complies with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 standards.
            \item Communicates user requests and display outputs from the backend.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Session History Manager}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Purpose:} To ensure the continuity of the current session and manage user data during active use of the system.
        \item \textbf{Key Functions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Track unique user sessions throughout interaction with the web application.
            \item Store previously uploaded images and generated alternative text for the current session to allow users to view history.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

    \item What went well while writing this deliverable?

    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?

\textbf{Casey Francine Bulaclac - Reflection}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? \\[1ex]
    Writing this deliverable was organized as the team split the sections beforehand, so we had clear instructions on how and who is completing which sections. It 
    was also helpful completing the SRS before this document as it helped define certain sections such as the System Boundaries and Components. 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?\\[1ex]
    One challenge I ran into with this deliverable were keeping the language and details aligned with the SRS. Another challenge was having to finish one section before I could move on 
    to others as some sections depended on previous ones. To address this, I double-checked the SRS and kept clear, timely communication with my team about what needed to be done and by when.
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about? \\
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?\\[1ex]
    One main risk in software products is in security and privacy. Situations such as unauthorized access and data leaks can harm users of the software and 
    can violate laws. This can also lead to damage of the developer's reputation, as well as fines and lawsuits. Another risk in software products is failure to comply with 
    certain required regulations. For example, violating licenses or accessibility rules can result in the delay or blocking of deployments, and may also lead 
    to legal issues.
