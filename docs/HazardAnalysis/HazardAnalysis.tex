\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Students with disabilities confront major challenges to reading technical diagrams, which are often given in the form of static images that screen readers cannot interpret. Manually developing alternative (alt) text is possible, but it is resource-intensive, inconsistent, and not scalable for huge volumes of course content. This generates disparities in access to learning materials in postsecondary education.

To address this issue, this project proposes creating an AI/ML-powered application that automatically generates clear and detailed alt text for technical diagrams. The tool intends to increase accessibility, assure compliance with AODA regulations, and promote greater inclusion in higher education.

\subsection{Hazard Analysis Introduction}
A hazard is a system state or combination of conditions that, when paired with specific environmental or contextual factors, can result in an unwanted or adverse event in the system or its surroundings. Hazards in software and AI development encompass not only physical threats but also usability, ethical, and technological issues.

Hazards in this project may develop during the design, training, and implementation of the alt-text generating model. These risks include technical flaws in generated text, misinterpretations that may mislead learners, ethical concerns regarding bias in the dataset, and compatibility issues with assistive technology.

This hazard analysis identifies and evaluates such risks to guarantee that the system provides consistent accessibility gains while not mistakenly introducing new obstacles.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}
The objective of this hazard analysis is to analyze the potential hazards and damages related to the AI/ML alt-text generating tool throughout its development and operation. The most significant hazards are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Technical Flaws:} Incorrect or inadequate alt text may mislead students, impair comprehension, or violate accessibility guidelines. This could result in a loss of confidence in the tool and poor results in education.
    \item \textbf{User Insensitivity:} Alt text that is excessively technical, unsophisticated, or inconsistent may not meet the needs of students. This may result in a loss of usefulness, reducing participation among students, teachers, and accessibility professionals.
    \item \textbf{External Dependencies:} Relying on third-party libraries, APIs, or screen reader compatibility can lead to external failures. Interruptions in these functions may result in a loss of functionality or downtime.
\end{itemize}

The purpose of this hazard study is to systematically identify these hazards, estimate their potential impact, and develop mitigation strategies. By doing this, we aim to minimize losses associated with time, trust, resources, and accessibility outcomes, ensuring that the tool contributes positively to equitable education.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
  You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel
  for the major
  ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will
  typically include
  each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a
  database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\subsection{System Overview}

            \item Retrieve generated alt text from the model and return it to the user interface. 
            \item Interact with the Session Manager to store or retrieve session data such as previous uploads and generated results.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\section{Critical Assumptions}
This section documents the assumptions made during the hazard analysis of
\progname{} (Reading4All). The number of assumptions is kept to a minimum
to reduce the chance of overlooking potential hazards. Where assumptions
are made, they set clear boundaries for the analysis and define the
conditions under which the system is expected to operate safely.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Assumption 1: Input Integrity.} All image files provided
    to the system are assumed to be valid image formats and not corrupted
    or maliciously constructed to exploit parsing vulnerabilities.

  \item \textbf{Assumption 2: Standards Stability.} Accessibility
    guidelines (WCAG 2.1, AODA) are assumed to remain stable for the
    operational lifetime of the system.

  \item \textbf{Assumption 3: Model Performance.} The machine learning
    models used for visual recognition and natural language generation are
    assumed to operate within validated ranges of accuracy and reliability.

  \item \textbf{Assumption 4: Human Oversight.} It is assumed that
    alternative text generated by the system will undergo review by human
    instructors, teaching assistants, or accessibility specialists before
    being used in educational contexts.
\end{itemize}

Violations of these assumptions may introduce additional hazards outside
the current scope of this analysis. Such cases would require
re-evaluation of risks and system design updates.

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\begin{enumerate}[label=PR-SR-HA \arabic*., wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
  \item \emph{The system must notify the user when a timeout occurs during alternative text generation.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Users should be informed when the alternative text generation exceeds the expected amount of time. If users are not notified they may send multiple requests, leading the server to be overloaded; this would also lead to user frustration.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} When a timeout occurs, the system displays a message indicating the timeout and a "Retry" option. The message must follow accessibility guidelines and be compatible with screen readers.\\
    {\bf Priority:} Medium\\
    {\bf Hazard Analysis Connected}: HA4
  \item \emph{The system must safely exit when a timeout occurs and ensure that no user data or incomplete alternative text is stored or shown to the user.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Safely exiting during a timeout prevents users from seeing incomplete alternative text and mistaking it for a complete output, which may cause confusion. Leaving user data stored would also be a security violation. \\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} When a timeout occurs, the system must stop processing and delete the users data and any incomplete alternative text that has been generated.\\
    {\bf Priority:} High\\
    {\bf Hazard Analysis Connected}: HA4
  \item \emph{The system must ensure that messages notifying the user of failure, do not reveal any system code or data. }\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} This will prevent internal data from being shown to users, which may lead to system and user security issues. \\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} All error messages shown to the user only display the necessary information and do not contain any technical information.\\
    {\bf Priority:} High \\
    {\bf Hazard Analysis Connected}: HA4, HA7

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? \\[1ex]
    Completing part 6, where we outlined the Safety and Security requirements, 
    went well for several reasons. Firstly, completing the previous section 5 helped us directly derive the new Safety and
    Security requirements that needed to be outlined. Additionally, working on this document after finishing the SRS
    document made the process much easier, as we had gained a lot of practice with determining and writing requirements from the SRS. 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?\\[1ex]
    One pain point we faced during this deliverable was the dependency on other sections within the 
    HA document and the SRS document. For example, to complete section 5 in the HA document, we needed
    the requirements in SRS to be completed so they can be referenced as needed. This was challenging as 
    developing our SRS requirements was a long process that required significant work and detail; 
    meanwhile, the HA Failure Mode and Effect analysis also needed extensive work.  
    This made it hard to manage our time effectively, as the two documents couldn’t be worked on in parallel at times. 
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?\\[1ex]

  \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?\\[1ex]
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Nawaal Fatima  - Reflection}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{What went well while writing this deliverable?}\newline
    I think the easiest part was coming up with the assumptions
    themselves. From my summer work experience with Ms. Sui, I was already familiar with the main areas where Reading4All
    could run into issues (inputs, standards, model accuracy, and
    human review), it felt pretty natural to turn those into clear
    assumptions. It also helped that the section didn’t need to be
    super long, so I could keep it focused and to the point.

  \item \textbf{What pain points did you experience during this
    deliverable, and how did you resolve them?}\newline
    The tricky part was figuring out how much detail to put in
    without overcomplicating things. At first, I thought about
    writing assumptions that basically ruled out certain failures,
    but I realized that would go against the whole idea of hazard
    analysis. To fix that, I stuck to assumptions that made sense for
    defining boundaries without pretending hazards don’t exist.
    Another small challenge was making the wording simple enough - so
    I rewrote a couple of the assumptions to sound clearer and less
    ``technical report'' heavy.
